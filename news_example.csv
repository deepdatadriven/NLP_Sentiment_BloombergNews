"Didi Buys 99 Taxis, Igniting Fight With Uber in Latin America",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-03/didi-buys-99-taxis-igniting-fight-with-uber-in-latin-america,"January 3, 2018, 4:04 PM EST",technology,,"Didi Chuxing is buying Brazilian ride-hailing company 99 Taxis, placing Didi in direct competition with Uber Technologies Inc. in one of the U.S. company's busiest international markets.Didi, which led a $100 million investment in 99 Taxis a year ago, announced the acquisition on Wednesday. ??Globalization is a top strategic priority for DiDi,"" Cheng Wei, the Chinese ride-hailing company's chief executive officer, said in a statement.Didi didn't disclose terms of the cash deal. Technology news site The Information had previously reported about talks between the two companies.The deal is a sign that the exploding ride-hailing industry may become dominated by global companies, rather than local monopolies. It also shows that Didi wants to lead consolidation and is prepared to spar with Uber even though they will soon share SoftBank Group Corp. as a major shareholder.After Uber sold its Chinese business to Didi in exchange for about a 17.5 percent stake in the Chinese company in August 2016, it looked like the era of fierce competition and massive losses might end. Together Didi and Uber had spent heavily on driver subsidies in China, burning cash to fight for market share. Their deal -- and another between Uber and Yandex NV in Russia in 2017 -- signaled that consolidation might allow for single regional leaders.Uber's recent deal with SoftBank, already a big backer of Didi, had raised questions about whether Uber might strike truces with other SoftBank-backed companies like Ola in India or Grab in Southeast Asia.Now, Didi -- which faces competition at home from Meituan -- is eyeing one of the international markets where Uber has faced the least competition. Sao Paulo and?Rio de Janeiro are Uber's top two busiest cities in the world as ranked by the number of trips that take place there.""The investment marks a significant next step of DiDi's global strategy,"" the company said in a statement. ""DiDi has entered partnerships with seven major international players, in a network that serves over 1,000 cities and reaches over 60% of world population."""
Boeing Gets $6.6 Billion From Pentagon to Expand Missile Defense,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/boeing-gets-6-6-billion-from-pentagon-to-expand-missile-defense,"January 31, 2018, 5:01 PM EST",politics,"""Missile Defense Agency extends Boeing management by six years"", ""Contract calls for buying 20 more Orbital ATK interceptors""","Boeing Co. has received a $6.56 billion contract to continue managing the U.S. missile defense system intended to stop North Korean or Iranian intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Defense Department said.The sole-source contract announced Wednesday extends Boeing's management role for six more years, through 2023, and brings its total contract to $12.6 billion. It includes overseeing the addition of 20 ground-based interceptors to the 44 already stationed in California and Alaska.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to perfect a nuclear warhead and a missile that could hit the U.S. mainland, adding to the urgency of U.S. missile defense efforts. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said, ??North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.??Boeing oversees development and support of the network of interceptors, sensors and communications links, sharing funding with subcontractors: Orbital ATK Inc. builds the rocket booster, Raytheon Co. makes the hit-to-kill warhead, Northrop Grumman Corp. provides the battle management system and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. makes the warhead's in-flight guidance system.The Pentagon released an initial $213.8 million Wednesday as a modification to Boeing's current $6.14 billion management, development and sustainment contract, which expires this year.As the Missile Defense Agency's prime contractor, Boeing will manage the accelerated construction of a new 20-missile field at Fort Greely, Alaska, plus the additional interceptors. Boeing also will oversee development and integration of an upgraded warhead known as the ??Redesigned Kill Vehicle.??Confidence in the $36 billion missile defense system was bolstered last week by a new assessment from the Pentagon's operational testing director based on the successful interception in May of a dummy warhead. The system ??demonstrated the capability to defend the U.S. homeland from a small number?? of ICBMs launched ??with simple countermeasures when the?? U.S. employs ??its full sensors/command and control architecture,?? Robert Behler said in a report to top Pentagon officials.Laura Grego, senior scientist for the Global Security Program of the Union of Concerned Scientists, questioned even that carefully hedged formulation. The system has destroyed ??its target fewer than half the 17 times it has been tested, and its record is not improving over time. Since the 2004 deployment decision, the system has a three-for-nine record,?? including the test in May, she said in an email.On Tuesday, General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that North Korea's capabilities aren't yet as advanced as Kim purports.North Korea has yet to demonstrate essential capabilities for an ICBM that could hit the U.S. mainland, including maneuvering in space, an adequate guidance system and housing that could protect a nuclear warhead from burning up on re-entry.The capability gap provides ??an opening to have?? a conversation with North Korea about a possible missile test freeze, Selva said.While North Korea's nuclear weapons program is the most advanced threat, Trump has vowed to seek new sanctions on Iran for its continued development of ballistic missiles. Iran maintains it has no intention to develop nuclear weapons, and its nuclear program is constrained by its 2015 deal with the U.S. and other world powers."

The decision was partly triggered by the state government's veto of A$900 million in potential federal funding for a new rail link, which is needed to carry coal from Carmichael to the coast for export, Adani said. The mine will be developed on a owner-operator basis now.Given uncertainty over the funding and timing of the first phase of the project, it made more sense to keep tight control on costs and development within Adani, according to Fat Prophets resources analyst David Lennox. ??Once the funding and timetable is securely in place, they may return to the market for specific construction services,?? he said.In addition to the state government opposing a federal loan for the project,?major lenders from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Australia's big four banks have preemptively excluded themselves from financing the Carmichael development because of their opposition to polluting fossil-fuel projects.

"Intel, Microsoft Deal With Widespread Computer-Chip Weakness",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-04/intel-microsoft-grapple-with-widespread-computer-chip-weakness,"January 3, 2018, 7:56 PM EST",technology,"""Vulnerability left wide swath of devices open to cyberattack"", ""Hardware security gaps are less common, can be tougher to fix""","The world's biggest chipmakers and software companies, including Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp., are coming to grips with a vulnerability that leaves vast numbers of computers and smartphones susceptible to hacking and performance slowdowns.Google researchers recently discovered that a feature, present in almost all of the billions of processors that run computers and phones around the world, could give cyberattackers unauthorized access to sensitive data -- and whose remedy could drag on device performance. News of the weakness, found last year and reported Tuesday by The Register technology blog, weighed on shares of Intel, the biggest semiconductor maker, while boosting rivals including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Intel's silence for most of Wednesday added to investors' unease.Late in the day, Intel, Microsoft, Google and other tech bellwethers issued statements aimed at reassuring customers and shareholders. Intel said its chips weren't the only ones affected and predicted no material effect on its business, while Microsoft, the largest software maker, said it released a security update to protect users of devices running Intel and other chips. Google, which said the issue affects Intel, AMD and ARM Holdings Plc chips, noted that it updated most of its systems and products with protections from attack. Amazon.com Inc., whose AWS is No. 1 in cloud computing, said most of its affected servers have already been secured.Hackers for decades have exploited security holes in software -- for example, by inducing careless, unsuspecting users to open attachments that unleash viruses or other malware onto a device or network. The weakness uncovered by Google, by contrast, underscores the potential damage wreaked by vulnerabilities in hardware. Complex components, such as microprocessors, can be harder to fix and take longer to design from scratch if flawed.??It's a big one and it's a severe one. This gives an attacker capabilities that bypass the common operating system security controls that we've relied on for 20 years,?? said Jeff Pollard, an analyst at Forrester Research. ??There's big impact on both the consumer and enterprise.??Read more: What You Need to Know About the Big Chip Security ProblemGoogle said in a blog post that it privately informed Intel, ARM and AMD of these issues on June 1 last year to give them time to find remedies before the vulnerabilities became public. While the companies were working on fixes, the same vulnerabilities were independently discovered by a team of researchers affiliated with several academic institutions and computer security firms.In research papers made public online Wednesday, this second group of researchers identified a potential cyberattack that could exploit these vulnerabilities. Calling it ??Meltdown,?? the researchers said that in their tests it affected Intel chips most seriously but could also be used against ARM and AMD processors.The researchers say they discovered another potential attack they dubbed ??Spectre?? that would be difficult to pull off but also harder to fix. In a paper on Spectre, they said that chipmakers had long prioritized processing speed over security. ??As the costs of insecurity rise, these design choices need to be revisited, and in many cases alternate implementations optimized for security will be required,?? the researchers said.Intel's stock remained under pressure even after its statement. The company's shares were down 2.2 percent to $44.28 in early trading in New York.??We struggle to believe that Intel won't face some sort of financial liability,?? analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a note.China's largest cloud computing services scrambled Thursday to address the issue. Domestic industry leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it planned to update its systems from 1 a.m. on Jan. 12 to handle potential chip security issues. Rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. said it was in touch with Intel on possible fixes but wasn't aware of any attempted attacks.Applying the operating system upgrades designed to remedy the flaw could hamper performance, security experts said. The Register reported that slowdowns could be as much as 30 percent -- something Intel said would occur only in extremely unusual circumstances. Computer slowdowns will vary based on the task being performed and for the average user ??should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,?? Intel said, adding that it has begun providing software to help limit potential exploits.Intel's efforts to play down the impact resulted in a war of words with AMD. Intel said it's working with chipmakers including AMD and ARM Holdings, as well as operating system makers to develop an industrywide approach to resolving the issue. AMD was quick to retort, saying, ??there is near-zero risk?? to its processors because of differences in the way they are designed and built.The vulnerability doesn't just affect PCs. All modern microprocessors, including those that run smartphones, are built to essentially guess what functions they're likely to be asked to run next. By queuing up possible executions in advance, they're able to crunch data and run software much faster.The problem in this case is that this predictive loading of instructions allows access to data that's normally cordoned off securely, Intel Vice President Stephen Smith said on a conference call. That means, in theory, that malicious code could find a way to access information that would otherwise be out of reach, such as passwords.??The techniques used to accelerate processors are common to the industry,?? said Ian Batten, a computer science lecturer at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. who specializes in computer security. The fix being proposed will definitely result in slower operating times, but reports of slowdowns of 25 percent to 30 percent are ??worst-case?? scenarios, he said.Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told CNBC that a researcher at Google made Intel aware of the issue ??a couple of months ago.??Brian Krzanich??Our process is, if we know the process is difficult to go in and exploit, and we can come up with a fix, we think we're better off to get the fix in place,?? Krzanich said, explaining how the company responded to the issue.Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., identified the researcher as Jann Horn. While many of its products have already been protected, some customers of Android devices, Google laptops and its cloud services still need to take steps to patch security holes, the internet giant said.Microsoft on Wednesday released a security update for its Windows 10 operating system and older versions of the product to protect users of devices with chips from Intel, ARM and AMD, the company said in a statement. Late in the day, Microsoft said the majority of Azure cloud infrastructure has been updated with the fix and most customers won't see a noticeable slowdown with the update.??We have not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been used to attack our customers,?? Microsoft said. The fixes were originally planned for release on Jan. 9, but were rushed out Wednesday after the weakness was made public, according to a person familiar with the situation.Apple Inc. didn't respond to requests for comment about how the chip issue may be affecting the company's operating systems.Providers of computing power and services via the internet will have to upgrade software to work around the potential vulnerability, which will require additional lines of code, computing resources and energy to perform the same functions while maintaining security, said Frank Gillett, another analyst at Forrester.??When you're running billions of servers, a 5 percent hit is huge,?? he said.??

Uber also has a presence in Australia, where both Uber ride summoning and UberEATS food delivery are growing businesses.The overlap between Uber's regional footprint and SoftBank's investments in Asia have led to questions whether there might be consolidation among ride-hailing businesses, or market exits. For example, SoftBank-backed Grab is competing head-to-head with Uber in Southeast Asia.??Ola and Uber now have a common investor and if not rightaway, there's bound to be a push from SoftBank on how to get the two to burn less cash by not competing directly with each other,?? said Satish Meena, a New Delhi-based analyst at Forrester Inc. ??Even if there's no merger between the two, there's likely to be synergies.??Founded in 2011 by two Indian engineers in their twenties, Ola has 125 million users and more than a million drivers in 110 cities. The company said in its statement that it serves over a billion rides annually via cabs, street taxis and three-wheeler autorickshaws.??With a strong focus on driver-partners and the community at large, we aim to create a high-quality and affordable travel experience for citizens and look forward to contributing to a healthy mobility ecosystem in Australia,?? Aggarwal said."

It extends to work-related social events, off-sites and client events. It includes mandatory sexual harassment training for managers and outlines an investigation process that protects employees from adverse consequences. One clause says that employees can be fired if they retaliate against a co-worker who makes a harassment claim.??We're very vocal with our community that if there is a hint of something, we want you to come to the resources we have with our human resources team, investigations or legal team for people to weigh into this and do something about this,?? Maxine Williams, Facebook's global director of diversity, told Bloomberg News in an interview on Tuesday.Along with other high-profile companies in entertainment and media, tech firms and the venture capitalists that fund them have been grappling with increasingly widespread sexual harassment allegations. Most recently, Shervin Pishevar, an early Uber investor, said he's taking a leave of absence from his companies after a Bloomberg report detailed six allegations of harassment or assault.Half of technology entrepreneurs have either been harassed in the office or know somebody who has, a recent study by First Round Capital, a venture firm, found. Only 17 percent of startups have a formal strategy to promote diversity and inclusion.??Sharing best practices can help us all improve, especially smaller companies that may not have the resources to develop their own policies,?? Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in a joint statement with the company's vice president of people Lori Goler. Earlier this week, Facebook was named the best place to work by Glassdoor, a job site that asks employees to rate their company.Facebook posted its policy on the company's site along with their mandatory training program and documents on managing bias. ??There's no question that this is complicated and challenging to get right,?? Sandberg and Goler said. ??We are by no means perfect, and there will always be bad actors.??"
U.S. Says North Korea Was Behind WannaCry Cyberattack,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/u-s-blames-north-korea-for-cowardly-wannacry-cyberattack,"December 18, 2017, 8:19 PM EST",politics,"""Homeland security adviser Tom Bossert says U.S. has evidence"", ""Kim Jong Un's regime has grown adept at hacking computers""","The U.S. blamed North Korea for the WannaCry ransomware attack that affected hundreds of thousands of computers globally this year, offering further justification for the White House's campaign to step up international pressure on the regime.??After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea,?? White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told reporters Tuesday. ??We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners.??WannaCry crippled parts of the U.K.'s state-run National Health Service and compromised companies such as FedEx Corp. and Nissan Motor Co.After WannaCry began infecting computers powered by Microsoft Corp.'s Windows via the internet on May 12, users had 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin, or pay twice as much. Paying didn't unlock their computers, Bossert wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that was published Monday.??It was cowardly, costly and careless,?? he wrote. ??The attack was widespread and cost billions, and North Korea is directly responsible.??While calling the public attribution an initial step in holding North Korea accountable, Bossert said President Donald Trump had already exhausted many of the tools available for punishing the regime in Pyongyang as he seeks to halt its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.??North Korea has done everything wrong as an actor on the global stage that a country can do,?? he told reporters Tuesday during a White House briefing. ??President Trump has used just about every lever that you can use short of starving the people of North Korea to death to change their behavior. And so we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behavior.??Bossert called on governments and companies around the world to cooperate to mitigate cyber risk, and said the U.S. would lead the effort. Microsoft, Facebook and other companies worked to disrupt the attack and moved last week to disable North Korean accounts that were being used for cyber attacks, Bossert said.Jeanette Manfra, assistant secretary of homeland security for cybersecurity and communication, said that the companies should take additional steps to collaborate with the government to defend against cyber attacks..??We make it way to easy for attackers by operating independently,?? she told reporters. ??Our adversaries are not distinguishing between public and private so neither should we. government and industry must work together, now more than ever, if we are serious about improving our collective defense.??North Korea has been developing cyber capabilities as trade sanctions and a debilitated domestic economy make it difficult to invest in conventional military capabilities, said Tom Uren, a visiting fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's International Cyber Policy Centre.""Having a formal report gives more weight to negotiations when the U.S. approaches China, or Russia or anywhere else that might be providing North Korea with internet services,"" Uren said. ""It gives them something else to bring to the table.""Read more about North Korea's hacker armyThe U.K. government in October blamed North Korea for the attack on the NHS. Kim Jong Un's regime denied any connection. Until now, the U.S. hadn't publicly named Pyongyang as being behind the attack. In addition to the U.K., Australia, Canada and Japan are among countries that agree with the U.S. analysis, Bossert said.Bossert said that because the ransomware attack requested payment in cryptocurrency, it was difficult to assess how successful it was in raising funds.While North Korea allows internet access to only a small portion of its population, it began to train its techno soldiers in the early 1990s, according to South Korea's Defense Security Command. The country probably employs 1,700 state-sponsored hackers, backed by more than 5,000 support staff, according to ASPI.North Korea has grown increasingly adept at breaking into computer systems around the world for financial gain and strategic benefit. This year, the regime's cyber warriors have been linked to stolen U.S.-South Korean military plans and the alleged theft of $60 million from a Taiwan bank.The hackers drew international headlines in 2014 when they allegedly broke into Sony Corp.'s movie business as it was preparing to release ??The Interview,?? a Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy about meeting the North Korean leader."

The schedule shows who met with Mnuchin but not what topics they discussed.Mnuchin, who played a major role developing the administration's tax plan, had two phone calls with Cook in early April and then met with him in person on April 18, according to the calendar. Mnuchin met with Read on April 4 and Staley a day later.In the weeks before the April 26 tax outline was released, he also met with Mark Fields,  then the leader of Ford Motor Co.; MasterCard Inc's Ajay Banga; Best Buy Co Inc.'s Hubert Joly; and Jean Lemierre, chairman of BNP Paribas SA.The initial version of the tax plan called for cutting the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent and it also called for a one-time tax on U.S. companies' offshore earnings, without specifying the rate. The tax bill President Donald Trump signed in December set a 21 percent corporate rate and a levy of 15.5 percent on cash held overseas. Less-liquid assets overseas are taxed at 8 percent.Apple -- which has the largest offshore cash pile of any U.S. company -- stands to benefit the most from a lower tax rate on its overseas earnings. Under the old system, U.S. companies faced the corporate rate of 35 percent on their foreign earnings, but they could avoid paying the tax if they kept those earnings abroad.Apple said it would pay about $38 billion in taxes as a result of the new tax law, which imposes a mandatory levy on accumulated foreign income.Pfizer said Tuesday it had scored a nearly $11 billion gain from the tax revamp largely because of the changes to how overseas earnings are taxed.Mnuchin's calendar, which showed appointments from Feb. 14 through June 30, listed more than 40 meetings or phone calls with corporate executives and about 80 with foreign economic officials.??

As part of the settlement, Western Digital will be able to invest alongside Toshiba in a cutting-edge chip plant in Japan and receive a guaranteed supply of next-generation memory chips, they said.The partners have been locked in a legal battle since early this year after Toshiba said it would sell the chip business to pay for enormous losses in its U.S. nuclear business.?The U.S. company had argued Toshiba needed its consent to sell the business, an assertion the Japanese company disputed. Toshiba needed to raise capital to avoid seeing its shares delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.Toshiba shares have surged 10 percent since Bloomberg News reported the two companies were near a resolution to their dispute. Shares rose 1.3 percent in Tokyo trading Tuesday.Toshiba had stepped up pressure on Western Digital in recent weeks. Last month, the Tokyo-based company said it would accelerate investments in its new Fab 6 chip facility in Yokkaichi, blocking Western Digital from participating and raising the prospect the U.S. company wouldn't get supplies of newer chips that it will need to remain competitive. Toshiba also unveiled plans to raise 600 billion yen ($5.3 billion) in a stock sale, a deal that would help it avoid delisting even if the chip business sale isn't completed on time.How to Make Enemies and Lose Influence in the Chips BusinessToshiba's earnings results last month underscored the importance of the semiconductor unit. Profit in the memory business quadrupled to 205 billion yen in the first half of the fiscal year, helped by demand for data storage in smartphones and solid state disks. The division accounted for 88 percent of the company's operating income.Toshiba agreed in September to sell the business to a group of investors, including Bain, Apple Inc., Dell Inc. and South Korea's SK Hynix Inc. The deal is structured so that Toshiba and Hoya Corp. will hold a majority of the voting stock, a solution that keeps control of sensitive technology in Japanese hands. The transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals."

Trudeau vs. Singh Is Next Battle for Hearts of Canada's Left,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/trudeau-versus-singh-is-next-battle-for-hearts-of-canada-s-left,"December 19, 2017, 4:00 AM EST",politics,"""New Democrat leader also has mass appeal, penchant for selfies"", ""Singh vows new social programs paid for by taxes or deficits""","Justin Trudeau swept to power in Canada as a fresh face pledging to tax the rich and help the masses. Now a rival has picked up his playbook.Halfway through his mandate, Trudeau's two main challengers are in place for the 2019 election, each younger than he is. To the political right is Conservative Andrew Scheer, Trudeau's closest competitor in popular support and number of current lawmakers. But it's the man on the left who could determine the fate of Trudeau's Liberals.Jagmeet SinghJagmeet Singh, 38, the trilingual lawyer elected Oct. 1 as New Democratic Party leader, is taking on the prime minister at his own game, preaching left-leaning policies, a friend-of-the-masses mantra and an urban focus, all while indulging a penchant for selfies.Singh is looking to cash in on disenchantment as Trudeau fumbles his lofty pledges. ??They haven't actually invested in the social programs we're proposing or talking about,?? he said in an interview. ??Their commitments haven't really rung true.??The NDP, which has governed provincially but not federally, is a party member of Socialist International, and Singh's platform evokes shades of Bernie Sanders. He wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 19.5 percent from 15 percent, expand Canada's universal healthcare system and block?Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion, the country's only major proposed domestic oil pipeline. He also wants to create new tax brackets for high earners, raise levies on stock options and tax 75 percent of capital gains, up from 50 percent.??The first thing I would do would be an expanded social program and electoral reform,?? he said, listing options such as paying for pharmaceuticals and dental care, big-ticket items not covered in Canada's public system. Pharmacare alone would cost almost C$20 billion ($15.5 billion) annually, adding about 16 percent to federal spending.Singh is breaking from his predecessor, Thomas Mulcair, by considering deficits, while Scheer, who became leader in May, regularly criticizes Trudeau for running them.??I'm open to deficits if it's to keep the economy supported and also to prevent austerity, to continue supporting social programs,?? he said.An NDP win is currently a long shot. The party sits at 16.6 percent in polls, little changed from when Singh became leader. He has neither a seat in parliament nor any immediate plans to seek one. He regularly says reviving NDP fortunes will take time.This is all good news for Trudeau. Critically, the NDP's electoral strength in the last two elections has been driven by French-speaking Quebec, a province Trudeau's now targeting and where Singh has a problem.A Sikh man who wears a turban, Singh is the first non-white leader of a major national Canadian party. An?Angus Reid poll found 31 percent of Canadians wouldn't vote for a Sikh who wears a turban and carries a ceremonial kirpan knife; the share was highest in Quebec, at 47 percent. An NDP slump in the vote-rich province would open a door for Trudeau.Singh wouldn't rule out working with the Conservatives to topple a Trudeau government if the NDP held the most seats in a minority parliament. ??I'd be willing to work with anyone to help achieve our values,?? he said. ??The future's looking more and more bleak, and I want to get at: how do we build an economy where we all benefit???The party will look to capitalize on Singh's popularity as the Liberals did with Trudeau. The name Jagmeet -- pronounced ??jug like hug,?? he says -- is itself something of a marketing campaign with ??Jagmeet and Greet?? events. ""It means friend to the world,"" he said. ""And I'm a politician. That's literally what I need to do.""If his approach gains momentum, a strong NDP would threaten urban seats core to Trudeau's majority and steal votes from the Liberals, allowing the Conservatives to win key three-way races. So far, though, Singh has faltered -- in six mid-term elections since he became leader, the NDP captured a lower share of the vote than in 2015. If he can't revive his fortunes, Trudeau will have an easy path to victory in 2019."

Its first model will be available for sale next year starting at $45,000, compared with a $35,000 base price for Tesla's Model 3. Byton will complete its Nanjing factory in late 2018 and start production a year later.Byton ??is vying to become a global company created in China,?? said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of Automobility Ltd., who was at the Byton event. ??What the Byton team has achieved is a clear articulation of the future of mobility.??Related: Why the car after your next car will be an electricPromising internet connectivity and digital services in its Smart Intuitive Vehicles, or SIVs, Byton is among a crop of companies trying to upend traditional carmakers as powertrains move away from polluting fuels and battery makers seek longer driving ranges between charges.Byton received $200 million from a fund of Suning Holdings Group Co. and some state-owned firms in Jiangsu province, Kirchert said in August.

That compares with the 16.1 trillion-won average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of Samsung fell 1.6 percent to 2,559,000 won in early trade.Prices for benchmark memory chips have leveled off after a year of strong gains, limiting the growth that had powered Samsung to record earnings in the past two quarters. That has combined with rise of about 7 percent in the won against the dollar in the fourth quarter to erode the value of profits earned abroad. Still, rising demand for organic light-emitting diode screens helped to fuel a rise in sales to 66 trillion won in the quarter, compared with the 67.6 trillion won analysts expected.??The exchange rate probably undercut the earnings by 300 to 400 billion won,?? said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. ??Given special bonuses as well as a lot of?marketing expenses for smartphones and televisions in the fourth quarter, we can expect a?steep rise in the first-quarter operating profit to 15.9 trillion won.??Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, leads in the next generation of screens called organic light-emitting diodes. It supplies OLED screens for Apple Inc.'s iPhone X even as the two companies vie for dominance in the global smartphone market.Samsung won't provide net income or break out divisional performance until it releases final results later this month.Samsung's shares hit record highs in 2017 before sliding in November after?Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock?citing an expected peak in the memory chips cycle and a slowdown in smartphones.South Korea's government this month warned about the rise in the won and said it will take steps in the case of one-sided moves in the nation's currency.??The won-dollar exchange rate is worrisome,?? Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at Eugene Investment and Securities, said in a report before the announcement. ??The first quarter earnings are expected to be 15 trillion won.??Samsung is said to be planning to debut its new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S9, next month, presenting Apple's iPhone X with a sooner-than-expected challenger. Samsung is also seeking to release a phone with a bendable display to help fend off challenges from Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo and other Chinese rivals.The company's cash cow has been the memory business.?Contract prices for 32 gigabyte DRAM server modules nearly doubled last year while prices for 64 gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips rose 55 percent in the same period, according to inSpectrum Tech Inc.Samsung underwent a leadership change on the heels of its record earnings in the third quarter, with CEO Kwon Oh-hyun resigning to pave the way for Kim Ki-nam, a seasoned semiconductor engineer. The company's de facto chief, Jay Y.

What Drew Amazon and Alibaba to Bricks-and-Mortar: Q&A;,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/what-drew-amazon-and-alibaba-to-brick-and-mortar-quicktake-q-a,"January 29, 2018, 11:33 PM EST",quicktake,,"The world's online shopping giants are following smaller web retailers into what might appear to be the merchandising past. Amazon, Alibaba and most recently Alibaba's rival, JD.com, are operating brick-and-mortar stores, joining companies such as the formerly web-only Warby Parker, Athleta and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi. Even Tencent, the Chinese games and social media giant, is doing deals in retail. These companies are part of a new ""bricks and clicks"" trend blurring the division between online and in-person sales. Traditional store-based retailers are joining in by elevating their web game.Not everyone wants to shop online, or to buy everything that way, and some people simply can't. While China has close to 800 million people who access the internet, that leaves hundreds of millions who don't. But much of the population lives a short drive from one of the stores now backed by Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, or JD.com. In the U.S., 70 percent of millennials, now the biggest consumer group in the country, prefer shopping in a store to shopping online, according to one survey. Fresh food, furniture and appliances are among the items some shoppers prefer to inspect before buying.Mostly by investing in brands with existing store networks and retail expertise. Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, bought the U.S. grocery chain Whole Foods and its more than 460 stores in 2017 and has also opened 13 bookstores since 2015. Alibaba acquired a department store chain with 29 stores and 17 shopping malls last year and also bought a slice of a China's largest hypermarket chain. JD.com recently opened the first of a chain of high-tech supermarkets in Beijing while promoting franchises branded convenience stores across the country. And Tencent is leading a 34 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) investment in China's largest mall operator and investing in Carrefour's operations in the country.Probably not. Web retailers are learning that stores can complement and improve their online business. Physical stores offer advantages web stores don't, including walk-in traffic and spontaneous purchases. One survey found that 69 percent of customers who entered a store to pick up an item they ordered online bought additional products. Stores can double as fulfillment stations for deliveries of web orders. They can be marketing tools, helping raise the profile of brands that emerged online. And technology has enabled retailers to gather data on shoppers, learning who they are and how they move around the stores in a bid to push customized coupons.Yes. Purely web-based retailers don't have to pay for prime real estate in shopping districts and so, at least theoretically, can offer lower prices. But property costs could be balanced by the advantages of operating physical stores, while also reducing costs tied to shipping and returns. In some cases they are using a franchise model, putting more of the risk on individual small business owners than the big companies themselves.Because costs are fixed, a retail footprint becomes a millstone if revenue growth stalls. And opening new stores in prime shopping locations can be more challenging than building distribution centers on city outskirts. There are also labor costs associated with running stores.They are moving toward a blended model. Options like ""click and collect"" allow companies to offer the convenience of shopping online, while still keeping their stores at the heart of the retail experience. Customers can search , select and pay for a product online, but still visit physical locations, raising the possibility they'll step inside and buy more. Some large retailers are also expanding their stake in online shopping through acquisitions. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, agreed to buy web clothier Bonobos for $310 million last year to gain online prestige and reach customers that may not shop at its big-box outlets. The U.S. company also folded its Chinese e-commerce assets into JD.com.?? With assistance by Lulu Yilun Chen, David Ramli, Craig Giammona, and Spencer Soper"

In response to customer complaints, Apple apologized and cut the price of replacement batteries from $79 to $29 for many older iPhones.While analysts agree this was a good public-relations move, some are concerned it will dent future sales of iPhones, a product that accounts for roughly two-thirds of Apple's revenue.

Its platform helps clients host, optimize and analyze those sites.The Austin-based company had attracted interest from other potential acquirers and investors in the past, but it chose Silver Lake for its track record of helping businesses expand internationally, said Heather Brunner, WP Engine's chief executive officer. About a third of the company's more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue is from international customers, she said.??We really didn't need this investment to run the business,?? Brunner said in an interview. ??We're leveraging this partnership with Silver Lake to accelerate what's possible.??It's an early bet for tech-focused Silver Lake. While WP Engine is just seven years old and valued at less than $500 million, it's in a slice of the industry familiar to the Menlo Park, California-based private equity firm. Silver Lake, along with KKR & Co., bought website registration and hosting company Go Daddy Group Inc. for about $2.25 billion, including debt, in 2011.After several acquisitions, an initial public offering and a concerted effort to expand internationally, the company now known as GoDaddy Inc. has an enterprise value of about $10.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Silver Lake managing partner Greg Mondre and managing director Lee Wittlinger sit on GoDaddy's board.The two, along with managing director Mark Gillett, are also behind the WP Engine investment and will join the startup's board.??You've got a growing population, increasing internet penetration, more people coming online,?? Wittlinger said. ??These guys are already a market leader, sitting right at the center of these trends. And they're also attached to WordPress, which as a category has been doing fantastically well within this broader offline-to-online transition.??WP Engine counts General Mills Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and London's Heathrow Airport among its 75,000 customers, a number that increased 30 percent from a year earlier. Brunner said she's looking to use the cash to expand further in Europe, where the company has offices in London and Ireland, and in Australia.She also hopes to attract more marketing and advertising agency customers, which now include GSD&M and R/GA Media Group Inc.??The marketer is really the budget holder for digital spend,?? Brunner said. ??They want to have tools related to both how content and how their website is performing.?A key constituent for us are digital agencies of all sizes.??Before Silver Lake's investment, WP Engine had raised $41 million in private funding from investors including Silverton Partners and North Bridge Venture Partners. North Bridge's growth equity affiliate, which made the investment, is now Guidepost Growth Equity. Some early stakeholders will be bought out by Silver Lake in the deal, Brunner said.Silver Lake made the investment through its fourth buyout fund, a $10.3 billion pool it completed raising in 2013. The firm?oversees about $39 billion in assets and committed capital. In April, it finished raising a $15 billion fifth fund, the biggest tech-focused pool managed by a private equity firm.Royal Bank of Canada advised WP Engine on the transaction.(A previous version of this story corrected the Silver Lake fund making the investment.)"

Analysts had predicted 58.2 billion kronor on average. Adjusted for comparable units and currency rates, sales fell 7 percent. Adjusted operating profit of 400 million kronor missed estimates of 1.76 billion kronor.Ekholm spent his first year as CEO trying to revive the embattled company, which has been hit by lower carrier spending and competition from Huawei Technologies Co.

Sales in North America rose 2 percent.Ericsson's closely watched adjusted gross margin -- the share of sales remaining after production costs -- rose to 29.9 percent last quarter, from 29.4 percent a year earlier. That was in line with analysts' predictions. The net result in the quarter was a 18.8 billion kronor loss, burdened by earlier announced impairments and a revaluation of U.S. tax assets amounting to 15.2 billion kronor.Ericsson reiterated that it sees the market addressed by its networks segment declining by 2 percent in 2018.The company also announced that an almost year-long review of its media business had ended with an agreement to sell 51 percent of its Media Solutions business to One Equity Partners. Ericsson will retain a 49 percent stake, and also keep Red Bee Media, a smaller unit which provides broadcast services that Ericsson had tried to sell.Ekholm said none of the suitors were willing to pay what Ericsson asked for Red Bee, which made an operating loss of 300 million kronor in 2017.""Of course, I would have preferred to get a higher bid, but we didn't,??

Intel said it has begun providing software to help mitigate the potential exploits. Computer slowdowns depend on the task being performed and for the average user ??should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.??The company's microprocessors are the fundamental building block of the internet, corporate networks and PCs. Intel has added to its designs over the years trying to make computers less vulnerable to attack, arguing that hardware security is typically tougher to crack than software. Reports about exploits caused by a ??bug?? or a ??flaw?? that are unique to its products are incorrect, Intel said.??Intel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed,?? the Santa Clara, California-based company said. ??Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.??On Tuesday, the technology website The Register said a bug lets some software gain access to parts of a computer's memory that are set aside to protect things like passwords. All computers with Intel chips from the past 10 years appear to be affected, the report said.The vulnerability may have consequences beyond just computers, and is not the result of a design or testing error. All modern microprocessors, including those that run smartphones, are built to essentially guess what functions they're likely to be asked to run next. By queuing up possible executions in advance, they're able to crunch data and run software much faster.The problem in this case is that this predictive loading of instructions allows access to data that's normally cordoned off securely, Intel Vice President Stephen Smith said on a conference call. That means, in theory, that malicious code could find a way to access information that would otherwise be out of reach, such as passwords.??The techniques used to accelerate processors are common to the industry,?? said Ian Batten, a computer science lecturer at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. who specializes in computer security. The fix being proposed will definitely result in slower operating times, but reports of slowdowns of 25 percent to 30 percent are ??worst case?? scenarios, he said.Advanced Micro Devices said ??there is near zero risk?? to its processors because of differences in the way they are designed and built.??To be clear, the security research team identified three variants targeting speculative execution. The threat and the response to the three variants differ by microprocessor company, and AMD is not susceptible to all three variants,?? the company said in a statement.Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told CNBC that a researcher at Google made Intel aware of the issue ??a couple of months ago.?? Google identified the researcher as Jann Horn, and said it has updated its own systems and products with protections from this kind of attack. Some customers of Android devices, Google laptops and its cloud services still need to take steps to patch security holes, the internet giant said.??Our process is, if we know the process is difficult to go in and exploit, and we can come up with a fix, we think we're better off to get the fix in place,?? Krzanich said, explaining how the company responded to the issue.On the call, Intel's Smith said the company sees no significant threat to its business from the vulnerability.??I wouldn't expect any change in acceptance of our products,?? he said. ??I wouldn't expect any concrete financial impact that we would see going forward.??Intel's stock pared earlier losses after the announcement. The shares declined 3.4 percent to $45.26 at the close in New York. Competitor AMD, the only other maker of processors for computers, jumped 5.2 percent to $11.55.Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday released a security update for its Windows 10 operating system and older versions of the product to protect users of devices with chips from Intel, ARM and AMD, the company said in a statement. The software maker has also started applying the patches to its cloud services where servers also are affected by the issue.??We have not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been used to attack our customers,?? Microsoft said in the statement. The fixes were originally planned for release on Jan. 9 but rushed out Wednesday after a proof of concept for how to exploit the flaw was published, according to a person familiar with the situation. Microsoft had expected the security update to be deployed on about half of its cloud network by Jan. 9 and it's not clear if that timeline will change, the person said.Because the exploit takes advantage of a technology intended to accelerate the performance of the processors, the fix slows them, said the person. In devices with the current generation of Intel chips, the impact will be small, but it will be more significant on older processors. Microsoft is still looking at the impact on the speed of cloud services and how it will compensate paying customers, the person said.Apple Inc. didn't respond to requests for comment about how the chip issue may be affecting the company's operating systems.Providers of computing over the internet will have to upgrade software to work around the potential vulnerability, which will require additional lines of code, computing power and energy to perform the same functions while maintaining security, said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc.??When you're running billions of servers, a 5 percent hit is huge,?? he said.Cloud providers will likely have to throttle back the pace of new customers accessing their data centers while they take servers down to fix the problem, and there could be a price spike for servers as demand surges, Gillett said.??

Chief Executive Officer E. Hunter Harrison just two days after the railroad announced his medical leave resurrects questions about just how much companies should disclose about the health of their leaders.Harrison, 73, died Saturday of ??unexpectedly severe complications from a recent illness,?? CSX said without elaborating.?Harrison had been turning around CSX since being hired in March, as he had previously done at three other railroads. News of his declining health had pushed the company's shares down the most in more than six years on Friday.E. Hunter HarrisonLike former Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs, who battled pancreatic cancer before his death in 2011, Harrison had health problems and a reputation that buoyed shares in his company. Harrison had bypass heart surgery in 1998 and missed work in 2015 because of pneumonia and the implant of stents in his legs. Before CSX hired him, he declined the company's request for an independent doctor to review his medical records.In May, the Wall Street Journal reported Harrison's use of supplemental oxygen. In response, he said, ??Don't judge me by my medical record, judge me by my performance.??CSX investors cheered Harrison's performance, sending shares up about 60 percent in this year through Dec. 14, hours before his medical leave was disclosed. Shareholders had approved paying him $84 million he relinquished under a contract at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., and Harrison said he planned to guide CSX for the course of his four-year contract.?CSX fell 1.1 percent to $52.34 at 9:50 a.m. in New York. The shares tumbled 7.6 percent on Friday, the biggest drop since September 2011, after the medical leave was announced.??We are confident that our disclosures are adequate and appropriate,???Bryan Tucker, a CSX spokesman, said by email Sunday.Bloomberg Gadfly: CSX lost expensive CEO -- and contenders for his jobU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules don't require companies to disclose serious health problems in the executive suite, said Allan Horwich, a partner at Schiff Hardin and Northwestern University law professor. That said, a company couldn't issue half-truths or lie about an executive.??The most important thing is whether there were statements made by the company since he was hired that were inconsistent with the true state of his health at the time, and whether the company knew that,?? Horwich said. ??Did they knowingly or recklessly omit facts in what they said about the management team that would expose them to liability???Disclosures are judged by what the company knew in assessing the future, he said.??If things didn't turn out as they expected, that doesn't mean that the company lied or that the disclosure was defective,?? he said.One difficult area with CEO health disclosures is that chief executives don't always share all the information they have with their companies, said former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.??I find it difficult to understand the reasons that the company went ahead and hired him if he refused to make full disclosure of his health status,?? said Pitt, the founder of Kalorama Partners.Disclosure rules for a key executive also must weigh that individual's right to privacy, said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.??This is the classic example of when an individual's health is tied dramatically to the success of a company, it becomes a matter of disclosure,?? Elson said. His pay ??would suggest that his presence at the company was considered incredibly important to shareholders and therefore his health would be relevant.??Such situations always raise the risk of litigation, Elson said. ??Any time that people are disappointed and feel the company wasn't as forthright as they should have been, you'll see litigation,?? Elson said. ??But how does anybody know when their time is up???"

Antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said the deal could hurt competition on a number of routes, while Lufthansa says that keeping Niki afloat is costing it 10 million euros ($12 million) a week and that an extended review may prompt it to pull the plug.TUI Chief Executive Officer Fritz Joussen said Wednesday that a deal to lease seven?Boeing Co. 737 planes previously used by Niki to Lufthansa's discount unit Eurowings will stand regardless of whether the wider deal wins antitrust clearance.

Taylor Swift Wants Her Money Back,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/taylor-swift-wants-her-money-back,"January 31, 2018, 10:00 AM EST",,"""The superstar tightens the way her concert tickets are sold—and scalpers aren’t happy.""","Taylor Swift's most recent tour was a success by every measure. Named after the best-selling album of her career, 1989, it grossed more than $250 million worldwide, the top tour of 2015. Critics raved about the production, with one going so far as to say it was ??engineered to be the best night of your life.?? Yet Swift felt something was missing??about $85 million in revenue that went to scalpers.Some 30 percent to 40 percent of tickets to the world's top concerts are resold on secondary websites such as StubHub and SeatGeek. Many of those sales are by scalpers who believe people are willing to pay far more than the initial price to see stars of Swift's magnitude; they double and sometimes triple the ticket price. Thousands of Swift's die-hard fans, Swifties, spent huge sums the singer never saw. That didn't sit well with Swift, who is as much an entrepreneur as she is an artist.As she prepared to hit the road to support her latest album, Reputation, Swift and Ticketmaster Entertainment Inc. concocted a strategy to neuter the scalpers. They used Ticketmaster's Verified Fan program, which utilizes in-house technology to identify actual fans and determine which of them should have access to fan-only presale tickets, based on their devotion to Swift as measured by their willingness to buy albums, sign up for a newsletter, and watch her music videos. While prices in the presale were fairly low for most people, Swift and promoter AEG Presents raised the cost of all the tickets in the later general sale to make them less attractive to scalpers.The success of this latest attempt to combat scalping remains uncertain. Most major tours, including Swift's most recent, sell out in minutes. But her upcoming Reputation tour hasn't sold out a single date in the past month and a half, prompting the New York Post to dub it a disaster. Yet Ticketmaster says Swift will get the last laugh. Most tours sell out right away because prices are too low, and scalpers buy up all the inventory. Instead, Ticketmaster expects Swift's tour will sell out closer to when she takes the stage on May 8 in Glendale, Ariz., the first of more than 40 dates scheduled through October. It also expects the artist and promoters to collect more of the cash??and provide the music industry with a new model to boost North American concert ticket sales, which collectively hit $8 billion last year.??It's so easy for people to take shots at Taylor,?? says David Marcus, head of music at Ticketmaster. But, he says, ??we were successful beyond my expectations and were able to drive the biggest registration we've ever seen for Verified Fan.??Ticketmaster has used the Verified Fan program to block scalpers from concerts, festivals, and Broadway shows such as Springsteen on Broadway and the upcoming Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The company requires fans seeking tickets to register online in advance and identify the show they want to attend, hoping to weed out bots. It then uses artificial intelligence to determine which fans are most likely to attend and verifies a certain number for a presale.Swift's use of Verified Fan added tweaks not tried before, Marcus says. Fans who wanted access to the first tickets on sale took part in a program called Taylor Swift Tix where they earned boosts in the virtual line by buying her album and merchandise, watching music videos, or spreading the word to friends. Javier Benavente, a 25-year-old Swiftie who's seen the pop star more than a dozen times, bought three albums and scored floor seats for $180 a pop. The new regular-price tickets can run as much as 10 times that.What's more, Benavente says he loved being able to take his time deciding on his seat, because of the Swift tour's unusual assigned purchase windows??spread across a week and giving purchasers several minutes to view different available seats before making a decision. ??She somehow found this weird happy medium where you benefit both the fans and their pockets,?? he says.Some critics have called Swift greedy, panning her system as giving the best presale slots to fans who spend the most on her other goods. Ticketmaster says most of the fans who participated in the presale spent no money apart from the ticket purchase and noted those early sales started at $49.50??cheap for a star of Swift's stature. While tickets in the general sale can climb to near $2,000 for some shows, the prices aren't so different from those of male acts such as Justin Timberlake or U2. If some higher prices are what's needed to combat scalping, the Swift camp is unapologetic. Says Marcus: ??Taylor is trying to take control of her tour.??"

Crypto's stock closed at $149, less than a week after some insiders sold shares for $7 apiece in a private transaction, according to a regulatory filing.??This is not the kind of attention we wanted,???Crypto co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Poutre said in a phone interview. ??We want attention to be on the work we're doing.??The stock surge attracted the attention of market operator OTC Markets Group, which added a?skull-and-crossbones icon next to Crypto's stock symbol on Thursday to signal to investors to be extra cautious before buying the stock.Crypto is investing in and trading digital assets, and developing source code for managing them, according to its regulatory filings. Gilbert, an Australian who previously co-founded startups including one acquired by LivingSocial Inc., helped launch Crypto in January.The company had net assets of $3.6 million as of Sept. 30 and posted a $1.5 million net loss in the third-quarter, according to a filing.Gilbert isn't alone. Crypto co-founder and Chief Investment Officer Rafe Furst now has a stake worth $452 million. A run-up in ether, the digital money of the Ethereum blockchain, helped one unidentified crypto-trader turn $55 million into $283 million in a little more than a month earlier this year, at least on paper.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who sued Mark Zuckerberg over the genesis of Facebook Inc., said in 2013 that they had bought $11 million worth of bitcoin. That stake is now worth about $1.8 billion."

That number still pales in comparison to market leader Spotify, which disclosed Thursday that it now counts 70 million paying members. Iovine had ordered up video series to give Apple Music more exclusive features to entice subscribers, but projects such as ??Planet of the Apps?? and ??Carpool Karaoke?? haven't built much buzz. Cue's division has moved forward with its own plans for a slate of original shows, which may not be part of Apple Music.??A music service needs to be more than a bunch of songs and a few playlists,?? Iovine said in an interview early last year. ??I'm trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video.

Amazon Health-Care Move May Be Next ??Home Run' Like Cloud Services,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/amazon-health-care-move-points-toward-next-home-run-like-aws,"January 31, 2018, 2:00 AM EST",business,"""Online retailer has history of starting small, building fast"", ""Innovation and efficiency drove disruption in retail, IT""","Amazon.com Inc.'s foray into health care won't be the first time it has disrupted an entire industry by starting with an effort inside the company.Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos is teaming up with fellow billionaires Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon to revamp health care for the 2.4 million workers and dependents of the companies they run. The move fostered widespread speculation the trio will eventually make their approach to medical care available to companies far and wide.Bezos has a long, increasingly successful, record of starting new businesses on a small scale, often for the benefit of his company, then spreading them to the masses -- creating a world of pain for incumbents. Consider the ways Amazon is changing industries as varied as product fulfillment, cloud computing and even the sale of cereals, fruits and vegetables.Amazon created a network of warehouses around the country to make possible quick delivery of online orders, saving customers a trip to the store. But the access wasn't limited to consumers. Amazon opened its warehouses to brands and merchants in 2006 with its Fulfillment By Amazon program. Merchants pay Amazon to store, pack and ship their products to customers, part of the $7.9 billion in revenue from third-party seller services the company racked up in the third quarter, an increase of 40 percent from a year earlier. The service lets the Seattle-based e-commerce giant provide a big inventory for shoppers and take a commission on each sale -- a more profitable business than buying the merchandise directly.Amazon's cloud-computing business began as an internal data management system and has grown to an $18 billion-a-year business that is redefining corporate IT departments. Rather than buying their own servers and maintaining on-site data centers, companies pay Amazon Web Services for data storage and computing functions that they access via the internet.?Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. have followed suit, but Amazon remains the dominant player in the industry. AWS is the company's fastest-growing and most-profitable business, accounting for more than 10 percent of total sales in the third quarter. Without profit from the unit, Amazon may still be losing money because of its investments in e-commerce overseas.Amazon Go, a new convenience store in Seattle that lets shoppers check in with smartphones and leave without paying a cashier, is one of the company's latest attempts to redefine an industry. It spent more than a year testing the concept with employees before opening the store to the public earlier this month. The technology could be sold to other retailers, giving Amazon a greater presence in brick-and-mortar retail without opening additional stores.That history helps explain the out-sized market reaction to Tuesday's announcement that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.?are exploring ways to make health care more affordable and effective for employees. The employees and dependents of the three companies represent just 1.5 percent of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance, and a few businesses getting together to self-insure is hardly a new phenomenon. The expectation is that someone with Bezos' patience and tenacity will create a new way of providing medical benefits that can be sold to others. Amazon has hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers to create a focus group. Berkshire brings the risk-management expertise of its insurance subsidiaries and JPMorgan has the financial expertise.Amazon's e-commerce operation could be used to send medication direct to patient's homes, saving them trips to a pharmacy. Its cloud-computing division can store patient health-care records so they can be easily accessed by doctors anywhere. And its payments system could be used to automate payments with health-care providers.??There's the possibility for another Amazon Web Services success where they come out of nowhere and hit a home run,?? said Kirthi Kalyanam,?director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University. ??Amazon just opened a cashier-less store. I don't see any reason they can't create a primary care facility that let's you just check in with your phone.??"

The potential talent included Sean Hannity and Bill O&apos;Reilly. O'Reilly was?also fired from Fox over allegations of?harassment.Thiel, who brought Trump some rare support from Silicon Valley during the 2016 campaign and the early days of his presidency, was warned by another billionaire not to take any offers of Trump's friendship too seriously. But Thiel?""was certain of Trump&apos;s sincerity when he said they&apos;d be friends for life -- only never to basically hear from him again or have his calls returned,"" Wolff writes.Thiel also would back former Trump aide Steve Bannon in any?potential bid for president in 2020, as would other?big conservative donors like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and the Mercers, Wolff writes. Bannon was a key source for Wolff&apos;s book and was quoted making many disparaging remarks about the president and his family. On Wednesday night, Trump&apos;s lawyers sent Bannon?a cease and desist order to attempt to prevent him from making any more?comments about the Trumps.Thiel&apos;s interest in journalism goes back to his college days at Stanford University, where he founded the Stanford Review, a libertarian newspaper.?More recently, he funded a lawsuit that bankrupted media company Gawker, which had outed him as gay more than?a decade ago.

In 2016, developers earned $20 billion, a 40 percent increase from the year earlier.Apple said its App Store had a record-breaking holiday season, culminating with $300 million in purchases made on New Year's Day 2018, up from $240 million in the prior year. Developers typically get 70 percent of that revenue, though the proportion increases to 85 percent after customers have completed a year's subscription to an app. Consumers spent more than $890 million over the seven days starting on Christmas Eve.App Store sales growth may serve as an indicator of iPhone demand, since new owners are more inclined to spend money in the marketplace in the days after they get a new handset. Investors are playing close attention to any indicators of demand for the iPhone X ahead of Apple earnings on Feb. 1, when the average sales price the company publishes will indicate whether customers are preferring the $999 top-of-the-line handset to cheaper models.Apple has been prioritizing its services business, which includes the App Store, as global smartphone sales slow.

An initial round of sales for about 40 percent of the Petro tokens will begin next month for institutional investors, according to a white paper published Wednesday. While an earlier draft showed a transparent process with discounts as deep as 60 percent for early buyers, the final paper showed the transactions will be private.The plan is to sell the remaining tokens to the public at decreasing discounts to encourage their use in everyday shopping and bigger transactions, such as paying taxes. The sales represent a major initiative by President Nicolas Maduro to reorder Venezuela's economy after its bolivar currency became virtually worthless amid quadruple-digit inflation and one of the world's deepest recessions. They might also help the country skirt sanctions that discourage transactions in dollars.??This is the moment to accelerate the entry of the Petro, to have faith in what we've created, and in the technological and intellectual capacity of our country,"" Maduro said on state television Tuesday. ""The Petro will have a great impact in how we access foreign currencies for the country and in how we obtain goods and services that we need from around the world.??The reference price for the Petro will be tied to the cost of a barrel of Venezuelan oil, or about $60 in the second week of January. While Maduro has said the token will be backed by the country's oil reserves, the world's largest, there is no mechanism to exchange the cryptocurrency for crude or other hard assets.About 38.4 million Petros, out of a total 100 million, will be available to institutional buyers starting Feb. 20, with a series of increasingly smaller discounts applied to stimulate early demand, the white paper says. A sale of about 44 million Petros will begin a month later, featuring four levels of smaller discounts for every 5 million Petros until a final fifth block of 24 million is sold with no discount.The rest of the tokens will be held by by the Venezuelan Superintendency of Currency.Unlike the world's most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, which can be virtually mined using computers, there will be a set number of Petros, according to the white paper. Venezuela guarantees it will accept Petros as payment for taxes and fees.The government will also promote the Petro abroad, with emphasis on developing countries and allied nations, and via the state-owned oil producer Petroleos de Venezuela.Venezuela also may incorporate the Petro into the ??card of the fatherland,?? a state identification used to claim government subsidies and regulated foods, Maduro said Tuesday.The country is suffering a dire shortage of bank notes after the central bank failed to issue enough cash to keep pace with surging inflation. ATMs are empty across the capital, Caracas, and banks limit customers to withdrawing the equivalent of just a few cents a day. The International Monetary Fund predicts inflation will spiral to 13,000 percent by the end of this year, while the economy is set to contract 15 percent."

Drugmakers stand to benefit financially from joining the combined efforts, Gates said in prepared remarks at the?J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco.??Industry has the skills, experience and capacity necessary to turn discoveries into commercially viable products,?? Gates said in his remarks. ??And, frankly, the private sector has much to gain from pursuing breakthroughs in global health.??Gates outlined his foundation's goals to fight HIV, malaria, tuberculosis and reduce the infant mortality rate. Advancements in fields like immunotherapy and genetics could help solve some problems in the developing world, he said.??With creative thinking, we can do it in ways that are both sustainable and profitable,?? Gates said.The Gates Foundation is a philanthropic powerhouse that has spent nearly $12 billion on global health projects over the past five years, Gates said. It has an investment arm which has forged more than 60 partnerships since 2009 and invested over $1.8 billion.The traditional approach has been to tap into the corporate social responsibility activities of private companies, said Trevor Mundel, the Gates Foundation's president of global health.??We recognize those companies are motivated by being successful companies and by delivering returns to their shareholders,?? Mundel said in an interview. ??There's a certain business rationale for getting involved in global health.??Mundel mentioned the foundation's distribution networks and political relationships in China, India and Africa as strengths that corporations could leverage in a partnership. The Gates Foundation can help alleviate the risk of initiating expensive research for a new drug, for example through volume commitments.Among companies that have grown with help from the foundation is biotech firm Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc. The foundation bought a stake in 2013 to encourage the company's work on neglected diseases, and sold it three years later -- making a return of about 17 percent.In the next few years, Mundel expects to see continued growth in partnerships. ??It's on almost an exponential trajectory,?? he said."

Never mind two days.Cintia Puebla bought a set of shelves on SACI Falabella's website on Nov. 11. They were supposed to be delivered within two weeks, but a month later she still had no product and no response from the company. She voiced her concerns on a popular Chilean complaint website, where she learned that delivery problems are the biggest issue facing most retailers. The 28-year-old had already made her first payment.""I went to a store to cancel the purchase, but they said that there's nothing they can do,"" Puebla said. She has yet to receive the shelves, and all she's heard from Falabella is that there's a problem at the warehouse. ""I don't even want them anymore.""Welcome to customer service in Latin America.""For a long time, many retailers in the region have made logistics a second-tier concern,"" said Alvaro Echeverria, a Chilean mathematician and developer of the logistics app Simpliroute. ""They made sure that the shopping experience was good all the way to the cart, but what comes after that wasn't a concern for the CEOs.""With Amazon and Ikea making incursions into the region, retailers better get smart and start addressing the logistics hiccups marring their customer relations, Echeverria said.

The app?determines which of its army of thousands of part-time shoppers can deliver products from groceries to medicine in less than 90 minutes. Undurraga got the idea as a self-confessed heavy user of Amazon Prime Now in San Francisco.""The key of the software is showing the client in advance how long we will take to deliver,"" Undurraga says by phone from Mexico City. ""If you're asking for a six-pack of beer, we can use someone on a bike, but if you ask for 100 different products, we'll need a car.

The market, however, sees locals challenged to compete against Amazon's deep pockets and ""intense consumer centric approach,"" the bank said.Falabella seems to be trying to get it together. It announced plans to invest $1 billion in logistics over the next four years. That's a long time to wait for shelving."

A new partnership between Amazon.com Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has the potential to be one of the most ambitious employer efforts to date to control health expenses.?Here are five takeaways:There's buying power in numbers.?By combining three of the biggest companies in the world, with more than a million employees in total, the new venture will be able to directly negotiate better deals with sellers of prescription drugs, lab tests, and medical devices. The combined economic might could also give the companies more power over coverage decisions.Ever try comparison shopping for prescription drugs or elective surgery online? It's hard to do, in large part because existing players have little incentive to reveal their true prices. By cutting through the clutter, the companies could allow their employees to shop for drugs, lab tests and other basic services within their health plan, with much the same ease as shopping for electronics or groceries online.Prices for prescription drugs, which move through a complex chain of pharmacy-benefit managers and wholesalers before reaching patients, are especially hard to understand. Even big employers often have to travel to secure rooms in the offices of pharmacy-benefit managers to learn the secret discounts they are getting on brand-name medications. The new joint venture could make pricing information more accessible--and drive down profit margins for drug-plan managers such as Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health Corp., and wholesalers including AmerisourceBergen Corp. and McKesson Corp.Amazon.com has a habit of trying new initiatives in-house and then unleashing them on the wider world. The joint venture is internally focused on the three companies now -- but if the model succeeds it could expand greatly in the future, allowing other companies to buy into the new model, or set up competing programs.These companies aren't the first to try to ??disrupt' health care. The industry, at 18 percent of the U.S. economy, is a fat target, but the power of entrenched players and the complexity of the system makes it difficult to transform. Just two years ago, the Health Transformation Alliance launched with much fanfare, promising to ??fix our broken healthcare system.?? That group -- with members including International Business Machines Corp. and American Express Co. -- ultimately partnered with existing industry players including CVS and UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s OptumRx."
EBay Rises to Record High on Shift to Adyen; PayPal Tumbles,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/ebay-to-ditch-paypal-for-dutch-processor-adyen-lowering-costs,"January 31, 2018, 6:15 PM EST",business,"""PayPal will remain as an EBay checkout option until July 2023"", ""Most EBay payments will be processed by Adyen in 2021""","EBay Inc. rose to a record high after giving an optimistic revenue forecast and unveiling plans to shift its payments business from long-time partner PayPal Holdings Inc. to Adyen BV, a global payments company based in the Netherlands. Shares of PayPal tumbled.PayPal is currently EBay's payments processor, meaning merchants selling on the marketplace have to have PayPal accounts to accept funds, and it will remain a checkout option for EBay shoppers at least until July 2023. But Adyen will gradually take over processing EBay payments, beginning in North America this year and will handle a majority of transactions in 2021.EBay will use Adyen BV to process most of its payments. Bloomberg's Spencer Soper reports.EBay said the shift will result in lower payment processing costs for merchants selling on the platform and greater options for buyers. Adyen accepts payments in 150 currencies. PayPal could see a big blow to its total payments volume. Shoppers purchased $24.4 billion in goods on EBay properties in the final quarter of 2017.Analysts had largely expected the agreement to continue, and there will be concerns about total payment volume going forward despite EBay becoming a smaller portion of that number over the past few quarters. PayPal hasn't provided analysts with much color on the impact yet.""EBay's decision to reduce PayPal's prominence represents a major setback for PayPal,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co. ""Although the share of revenue from EBay has diminished over the years, the share of profit is far more substantial due to the terms of the spinoff. Furthermore, the possible deal to add Adyen more prominently helps propel Adyen to a much more meaningful competitive position.""EBay rose as much as 14 percent, to $46.22 Thursday, the biggest intraday increase since October 2015 and a record high. PayPal fell as much as 8.5 percent, to $78.08.The announcement surprised some investors, who expected the companies to announce an extension to their operating agreement. PayPal has played an integral role in processing payments on EBay for 15 years and offers credit products that help EBay shoppers buy more goods.??The planned evolution of our relationship with EBay is consistent with our strategic direction and growth opportunities and does not alter our financial guidance,?? PayPal spokeswoman Amanda Miller said.PayPal separated from EBay in 2015 to concentrate on expanding its electronic transactions business without being shackled to the slow-growing online marketplace. The separation included an agreement that EBay would continue to use PayPal to process payments on the site. EBay purchased PayPal in 2002 and phased out its own competing payments service at the time.PayPal said total payment volume rose in the fourth quarter as active customer accounts hit 227 million. Earnings excluding some costs were 55 cents a share, compared with the average forecast for 52 cents.In its earnings report Wednesday, EBay said gross merchandise volume, a key metric of the value of goods sold on the site, rose 10 percent to $24.4 billion in the fourth quarter, as the number of active buyers on the platform increased. Double-digit growth was a big milestone for CEO Devin Wenig, who has been working on a turnaround."

Eat healthier. Get to the gym more. Reduce the intake of sugar and booze.This year I added a new mandate to the mix: Cut back on social media. In 2018 I want to spend my leisure time on more productive pursuits, like reading books, or finally cracking a new podcast or that growing pile of unread New Yorker magazines.I don&apos;t think I&apos;m alone. Over the holidays, I talked to many friends and relatives who have either deleted Facebook or Twitter from their smartphones, or have tried to find other ways to waste less time in the brain fog that can come with scrolling through endless social feeds.In fact, declaring one&apos;s intent to limit social media use has become a peculiar new public ritual. ""I&apos;ve basically dropped off"" Twitter, said Anderson Cooper on his New Year&apos;s Eve CNN broadcast. ""It seems really toxic to me.""Internet analysts are even pondering the business impact of these resolutions. ""2018 is going to be an interesting year for Facebook. I'm hearing a lot of people's New Year&apos;s resolution is less (and often giving up Facebook),"" tweeted Creative Strategies&apos; Ben Bajarin.I haven&apos;t deleted any social media apps. I still use them every day and rely on them for news and to keep up with friends. But I have taken them off my smartphone home screen, to make it a little less likely that I&apos;ll lazily dip into an app before bedtime and inadvertently vaporize an hour.?A lot of folks are looking for other ways to impose self-restraint. My colleague Tom Giles has resolved to get away from what he calls ""perpetual Twitter,"" where he&apos;s logged in all day, and instead will check it just periodically. He says he wants to ""get away from the noise.""It&apos;s ironic: The internet has brought us an abundance of informational riches. And now we are desperately trying to figure out how to shield?ourselves from them.In fact I increasingly see tech companies split into two groups: those that take away our time, and those that save our time.Amazon is the king of all time-savers, obviating that trip to the store and the minutes spent waiting in line at the checkout counter. Google is a tremendous time-saver, providing lightning quick access to information.Other time-savers include Microsoft, with its workplace productivity software, and Apple, whose devices boot up quickly and get us to the tools we need.The time-wasters, on the other hand, aren&apos;t necessarily bad, but they can be dangerous. Google&apos;s YouTube is a massive time sink hole (spending half an hour watching the trailers for the original Star Trek movies??not a good use of time). Netflix is the other champion eater of time, but some of its shows are so darn good that it nevertheless feels nurturing (I binged The Crown over the holidays).Even Facebook and Twitter, at their best, can save us time, giving us news and opinions we wouldn&apos;t otherwise encounter. It&apos;s just that too often, you have to wade through grandstanding, hand-wringing and vitriol.""Twitter logs multiple votes for problems and I think everyone walks around and carries this weight all day,"" said the singer John Mayer on Cooper&apos;s CNN broadcast. Everyone who has felt a knot of anxiety from reading social media probably knows what he means.So, for 2018, I resolve, I&apos;m going to spend more time with the time-savers and less with the time-wasters.Right after I lose 10 pounds.A version of this article also ran in the Fully Charged newsletter.

Bitcoin has gained almost 1,700 percent in the period, trading just below $17,000 on Tuesday.If Bitcoin's gains puzzle even the most seasoned investors, so do Konzum's, which has a market capitalization of just $245 million.The Budapest-based company reported sales of just $140,000 in the first half, but a web of investments from tourism to finance helped generate earnings more than 100 times that via a network of subsidiaries. The stock took off after Lorinc Meszaros, the mayor of Orban's hometown -- who describes the premier as a friend -- first bought a stake in February. Orban has rejected opposition allegations that he's using Meszaros as a strawman.??Bitcoin and Konzum are comparable in that investors are buying into them because they don't want to miss out on their significant gains and not necessarily because of their fundamentals,?? said Zoltan Varga, an analyst at Equilor Zrt. brokerage in Budapest.

Thomsons Go Back to News Roots With Sale of Unit to Blackstone,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/thomsons-eye-retreat-to-news-roots-with-data-sale-to-blackstone,"January 30, 2018, 2:09 PM EST",technology,"""Agree to sale of a 55% stake in financial, risk businesses"", ""Canada's wealthiest family got start in news business in 1931""","David Thomson, the third-generation scion of Canada's richest family, is retreating to his news roots with the sale of his company's financial data business to Blackstone Group LP.Thomson, whose grandfather Roy launched the media empire with a tiny radio station in 1931, agreed on Tuesday to sell a 55 percent stake in the division to Blackstone Group LP, valuing the business at $20 billion. Following?a difficult decade that's traced the ups and down of global finance, as well as upheaval in traditional media, Thomson is tearing apart the merger of Thomson Corp. and Reuters Group Plc that he orchestrated only a decade ago.David Thomson??This is a watershed moment in the history of the company,?? Douglas B. Taylor, managing partner of Burton-Taylor International Consulting, said by phone. ??For several years I thought we would one day see the family selling the financial data business. Since the acquisition of Reuters there's been a high level of discomfort.??For the Thomsons, whose family holding company controls Toronto-based Thomson Reuters Corp., the deal will allow them to keep some revenue from the slower-growing financial-data business, while maintaining the legal and accounting units and the Reuters newswire, heir to the service that transmitted stock prices across the English Channel in the 1800s.News has always been near and dear to the three generations of the Thomson family, even as they built up legal, education and financial-data businesses and amassed one of the largest collections of Canadian paintings as their fortunes grew.Roy Thomson started the family business -- which has helped his descendants amass a combined fortune of about $22 billion -- with the purchase of a radio station in North Bay, Ontario, 87 years ago. Roy, a Depression-era radio salesman, figured it would be easier to sell his equipment if there were more stations.A few years later, he bought a newspaper in nearby Timmins, the start of what would be an empire of 200 newspapers stretching across North America and the U.K., including The Times, once considered the crown jewel of British broadsheets. That earned him --and then his son Ken Thomson -- the title of Lord Thomson of Fleet.Ken's son David Thomson, 60, took the reins of Woodbridge Co., the family holding company, after Ken died at his office on David's birthday in 2006. Not long after, he made the biggest deal in the company's history, buying Reuters for $17 billion and adding the global newswire to his financial data business.??I would like to say that my late father was more than familiar with this dream,?? David Thomson said at the time. ??He believed it was all about opportunity; it was all about possibility.??Thomson Reuters has struggled since the deal, with the stock falling during the financial crisis, and recovering at a slower rate than the broader U.S. equity market since then.The stock rose 7.1 percent to $46.52 at the close in New York, the biggest gain in more than eight years, giving it a market value of about $33 billion. Woodbridge controls Thomson Reuters with a 64 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, competes with Thomson Reuters in providing news, data and information to the financial industry. Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg, is a non-executive director at Blackstone.The deal with Blackstone will give the Toronto-based company a financial jolt, according to Drew McReynolds, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.??The transaction would provide Thomson Reuters with substantial financial flexibility to return capital to shareholders while investing in higher-growth opportunities, including potentially pursuing additional acquisitions in higher-growth market segments,?? he said in a note Tuesday.If the deal is completed, Thomson will continue to run the newswire, along with the tax and legal arms, while selling a 55 percent stake in the financial data unit to New York-based Blackstone. The deal values the data unit at about $20 billion including debt, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Blackstone agreed to make annual $325 million payments over 30 years for Reuters news content, the newswire reported.Woodbridge didn't respond to requests for comment.Roy's son Ken assumed control of the family business in 1976 when his father died. Ken extended the media holdings, which include the Globe and Mail, Canada's national newspaper, by adding book publishing, legal and scientific businesses. The purchases included the West Law legal business for $3.4 billion.While he amassed assets, Ken wasn't afraid to unload businesses when he saw fit. His first decision was to sell the two British newspapers, which were beset with union problems, to Rupert Murdoch and retreat to Canada, author Peter C. Newman said in a 1991 profile.Along the way, Ken Thomson developed a love of art, a legacy carried on by his children, including David, current chairman of Thomson Reuters. Ken was an avid collector of works by Cornelius Krieghoff, who painted scenes of Canadian rural life in the 19th century. He also collected landscapes of the ??Group of Seven?? Canadian painters, whose members included A.Y. Jackson and Lawren Harris. Thomson agreed to donate most of his collection of more than 2,000 pieces of Canadian and European art to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, including Peter Paul Rubens' masterpiece ??The Massacre of the Innocents.??Even with his vast wealth, Ken famously shunned the limelight and was known to watch every penny.Jim Pattison, a Canadian billionaire who sat on boards with Thomson, recalls seeing him trudging through the snow across a parking lot on his way to a dinner in Toronto. Thomson had parked his car a few blocks away from the event to avoid paying for valet service.??I'm a poor church mouse compared to him and here he's walking a block or two to save the money, I always remember that,?? Pattison said following Ken Thomson's death. ??He was always very frugal with his money.??While David is not the hands-on business leader his father was, he maintains an emotional attachment to the news business, notably his father's Globe and Mail newspaper in Canada.??The Globe and Mail is particularly meaningful to us as a family,?? Ken Thomson told Bloomberg News in a 2004 interview following the annual meeting of Thomson Corp. in Toronto. ??We're not going to let anything happen to the Globe and Mail.??More recently, David choked up in a rare speech in Toronto at the Canadian Journalism Foundation gala in 2016, vowing to back the paper even as print circulation falls and newspapers struggle around the world amid a digital shift.??We will always support the Globe,?? he said.??

The U.S. government has requested information from the company, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the probe is private.The inquiry is in early stages, they cautioned, and it's too soon to conclude any enforcement will follow. Investigators are looking into public statements made by Apple on the situation, they added. While the slowdown has frustrated consumers, investigators are concerned the company may have misled investors about the performance of older phones.?""We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them,"" an Apple spokeswoman said. She reiterated an earlier statement that the company ""never ?? and would never ?? do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.""A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Shares of the company rose less than 1 percent to $167.71 in New York trading Wednesday. Apple's stock has been under pressure amid reports of weaker-than-expected iPhone X sales ahead of its earnings report Thursday.Apple iPhone X smartphones.Several weeks ago, Apple said a software update released in early 2017 slowed down the performance of older iPhones models as a way to avoid the phones shutting down at random. When it released the update, the company hadn't said the software would slow down the devices. In December, Apple apologized for not clearly communicating this information and vowed to release another update to mitigate the concern.Earlier in January, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told ABC News that when the company put out the software update that caused the performance issues for older iPhones ??we did say what it was, but I don't think a lot of people were paying attention. And maybe we should have been clearer.??The slowdowns occur when an older iPhone's battery reaches a certain, unspecified point of low health and can be fixed if a user replaces the battery. As part of its public apology, Apple cut the prices of battery replacements in its stores to $29, a $50 discount.?Apple plans to release an iPhone software update, called iOS 11.3, in the next few months with new features that let users monitor the health of their batteries and protect against slowdowns. If consumers turn off the throttling, older iPhones will be more prone to randomly rebooting, Apple has said. The system affects iPhone 7 models and older, but not the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, according to the company.?John ThuneAfter apologizing to customers in December, Apple was sued by consumer advocacy groups and individual iPhone users in a global backlash. Government officials, including U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, have also questioned Apple about the slowdowns.???Even if Apple's actions were indeed only intended to avoid unexpected shutdowns in older phones, the large volume of consumer criticism leveled against the company in light of its admission suggests that there should have been better transparency with respect to these practices,?? Thune wrote in a January letter to Cook.For more on the iPhone, check out the Decrypted podcast:The situation is a self-inflicted black eye on the Cupertino, California-based company. Apple has been wrestling with some other software-related issues, including processor vulnerabilities that have affected other technology companies and a login flaw that allows intruders to access files on Mac computers without a passcode.Apple is delaying some key iPhone and Mac software features planned for release this year to focus on quality improvements, Bloomberg News reported earlier Tuesday.This isn't the first time the Justice Department has investigated Apple. In 2012, the department filed an antitrust suit against Apple and book publishers over the pricing of digital book downloads. In 2010 the department settled with the iPhone maker regarding anti-poaching agreements between the company and other major technology firms such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google.In 2016, the Justice Department investigated, and then dropped a lawsuit against Apple seeking data from an iPhone connected to a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California."

Wal-Mart Chief People Officer Jacqui Canney said in a statement.The move could address a painful reality of low-income hourly workers, whose cash flow is far from predictable. Income volatility has been increasing in recent years, according to research from the Pew Charitable Trusts, and studies from the Federal Reserve show a lack of emergency savings among many workers. The inability to weather an unexpected car repair bill or medical expense can send a low-income worker into a debt spiral, and financially stressed workers can be less engaged and not as productive.PayActiv Chief Executive Officer Safwan Shah said in an interview that he had been talking with Wal-Mart about a collaboration for almost a year. The retailer has the largest private workforce in the U.S., opening up a big market.??Every American worker faces unexpected and stressful between-paychecks expenses,?? he said in the statement. ??With on-demand access to earned wages, Walmart associates will be able to save more, avoid the financial traps that reduce their take-home pay, and get a level of stability that few service sector employers provide.??Michael Best, director of advocacy outreach for the Consumer Federation of America, said there is ??cautious optimism?? about financial-planning products such as the one from PayActiv. ??The only caveat is whether this creates other problems, and are there unintended consequences where workers find themselves turning to loans at the end of the month,?? he said."
Beware the $500 Billion Bond Exodus,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-17/beware-the-500-billion-bond-exodus-as-offshore-cash-comes-home,"January 17, 2018, 5:00 AM EST",,"""Tax law seen spurring ‘demand shock' as companies repatriate"", ""Multinationals parked foreign income in U.S. debt to avoid IRS""","Farewell, Ireland: It looks like corporate America will finally bring that cash home.For years, the likes of Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have stashed billions of dollars offshore to slash their U.S. tax bills. Now, the tax-code rewrite could throw that into reverse.The implications for the financial markets are huge. The great on-shoring could prompt multinationals -- which have parked much of their overseas profits in Treasuries and U.S. investment-grade corporate debt -- to lighten up on bonds and use the money to goose their stock prices. Think buybacks and dividends.It's hard to say how much money the companies might repatriate, but the size of their overseas stash is staggering. An estimated $3.1 trillion of corporate cash is now held offshore.?Led by the tech giants, a handful of the biggest companies sit on over a half-trillion dollars in U.S. securities. In other words, they dwarf most mutual funds and hedge funds.??There is going to be a significant unloading,?? particularly of Treasuries, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, a professor who specializes in corporate and international taxation at the University of Michigan Law School. ??The general consensus is that the best use of the funds is to distribute it out to shareholders.??That conclusion runs counter to the long-held promises of the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers, who repeatedly suggested their tax rewrite would encourage U.S. companies to bring the money home to hire workers and invest in their businesses.The $14.5 trillion Treasury market, of course, can absorb the selling pressure of even the largest corporate holders. There's little to suggest multinationals will immediately liquidate their investments. Many analysts say companies, rather than selling, could just let their holdings gradually mature.Yet even at the margin, a drop-off in demand could add to the government's burgeoning funding costs. Not only are interest rates on the rise, but the most sweeping tax cuts in a generation, which could end up?mostly benefiting shareholders, risk leaving the government with trillion-dollar shortfalls for years to come -- an expense that taxpayers would ultimately have to bear.And since Treasury yields are the global lending benchmark, any upswing could also ripple through the real economy in the form of higher rates on everything from credit cards to mortgages. Since September, 10-year yields have climbed over a half-percentage point, hitting a high of 2.595 percent this month.While multinationals may be less inclined to sell their corporate bonds, at least initially, the impact could be more acute, analysts say. In recent years, firms such as Apple and Oracle Corp. have become some of the top buyers of company debt. Apple alone holds over $150 billion in the bonds, exceeding even the world's biggest debt funds. The market itself is also less liquid, which means it takes far less to move the needle.Big corporations could dispose of a ??few hundred billion?? dollars of their total debt investments, said Aaron Kohli, strategist at BMO Capital Markets.IG bonds may cost an extra 20 basis points over Treasuries after tax law, BofA saysSource: Bloomberg Barclays indexesRepatriation has come back into focus ever since President Donald Trump signed the tax overhaul into law in December. Besides reducing taxes across the board, it did away with a decades-old provision that allowed companies to put off paying taxes on foreign profits until they brought the money home.Of course, it's important to understand that for most multinationals, offshore cash is really only ??offshore?? for accounting purposes. Under the old tax system, earnings attributed to foreign subsidiaries, often based in jurisdictions with low taxes or lax regulations like Ireland or Luxembourg, could be repatriated and remain earmarked as ??held overseas?? -- so long as it was stashed in U.S. securities. Apple, for example, manages its hoard from Reno, Nevada, where its internal investment firm, Braeburn Capital, is located.??The term overseas cash can be a bit of a misnomer, as it doesn't have to be overseas and in fact a lot of it isn't,?? said Michael Cahill, a strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That should limit any appreciation in the dollar related to repatriation over the longer term.Now, multinationals have eight years to pay a one-time tax on the accumulated income. Foreign earnings held as cash or equivalents -- previously taxed at a 35 percent rate when repatriated -- would be subject to a 15.5 percent rate. Non-liquid assets would be taxed at 8 percent.??Most multinationals will no longer tie themselves up in knots with their Treasury function with a big pile of cash that's trapped in a foreign corporation and invested in securities and that they can't use,?? said Richard Harvey, a former top tax official at the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department, who now teaches tax law at Villanova University.Goldman's Cahill predicts corporate cash will be a hot topic on conference calls as earnings season heats up. Any repatriation will likely come from money already parked in U.S. securities.??Repatriation headlines from the earning calls could cause investors to react,?? Cahill said.His analysis showed that eight firms -- led by Apple, Microsoft and Google's parent Alphabet Inc. -- accounted for almost two-thirds of the overseas cash held by S&P 500?companies. According to the most recent filings, they had over $500 billion in U.S. government bonds and corporate debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show. (The top companies generally hold securities due in under five years, according to Bank of America Corp.'s Hans Mikkelsen.)Apple, which has become something of a poster child for multinationals accused of sheltering profits overseas, had $60 billion in government debt and about $153 billion in company bonds. Microsoft held almost all its cash in Treasuries and debt issued by federal agencies, totaling $122 billion. Alphabet had $66 billion, with about two-thirds in government securities.How much money multinationals eventually repatriate is anyone's guess. But tax experts and analysts agree that whatever they raise from selling bonds will likely go to enrich shareholders.According to a recent study by Bloomberg Intelligence, the tax overhaul could lead to buybacks jumping by more than 70 percent on an annualized basis to $875 billion. The analysis was based on the growth in completed repurchases in 2004-2005, the last time a tax repatriation holiday was in place.Repurchases could jump 70% on an annualized basis to $875 billion after tax overhaul, according to Bloomberg IntelligenceSource: S&P Dow Jones Indices2017 is the latest 12 months ended September 30, 2017Apple may increase buybacks by $69 billion, adding to the $166 billion it spent on repurchases from June 2012 to September 2017, according to Gene Munster, a co-founder at Loup Ventures.??There will be reasons for some very large bondholders to maybe shake some of these bonds out of the portfolio,?? said Guy Moszkowski, a banking analyst at Autonomous Research.Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock declined to comment on the company's plans for its debt holdings, as did Microsoft representative Sarah Elson. Google's Winnie King declined to discuss the company's plans for its overseas cash before its earnings in February, while Cisco spokeswoman Andrea Duffy said the company is reviewing the tax changes and that it will address the subject on its earnings call next month.On Wednesday, Apple said it will repatriate hundreds of billions of overseas dollars, pay about $38 billion in taxes on the money and spend tens of billions on domestic jobs, manufacturing and data centers in the coming years. It also told employees it's issuing stock-based bonuses worth $2,500 each following the new tax law, according to people familiar with the matter.Nevertheless, Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson focused on what was left unsaid.??What's not said in this release is that there is more potential for increased buybacks for shareholders and acquisitions that might not have taken place if it were not for the cash influx from overseas,?? he said.Big multinationals still have good reason to bide their time, according to Richard Lane, a senior analyst at?Moody's Investors Service. Because their debt investments are so extensive, companies could end up inflicting losses on themselves with any large-scale selling.??I don't think there will be a rush to the door by these companies to sell this debt and causing increasing yields and lower pricing,?? said Lane.Regardless of what happens, what's clear is that U.S. multinationals will have little incentive?going forward to hoard low-yielding Treasuries or investment-grade corporate bonds as a way to avoid the IRS. Under the new tax law, companies that pay relatively low global effective tax rates -- a sign they're using tax havens -- would pay a minimum U.S. tax.Even if?companies don't sell outright, there's going to be a ??demand shock,?? according to Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. The longer-term risk is that ??the biggest buyer in some of these markets disappears.???? With assistance by Alex Webb, Mark Bergen, Austin Weinstein, Elena Popina, Dina Bass, and Mark Glassman"

Amazon made waves in retailing last year with its $13.7 billion purchase of upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc.??Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,?? Munster wrote, noting both companies focus on mothers and families. ??Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy.??Market-share numbers suggest a deal would be approved by regulators, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. would still have a larger share than an Amazon-Target combination, Munster said. He estimated a take-out valuation of $41 billion, or a 15 percent premium to Target's value. Target shares rose as much as 3.7 percent Tuesday in New York, while Amazon gained 1.6 percent.??Investors would view this as Amazon taking over the world and that's a good thing,?? Munster said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio.A Target representative declined to comment on the report.

The four properties the company has announced in central Tokyo, which will start opening from February, will also have special rooms for mothers.??Not only dogs, and not that there's a parallel, but people in the future will need to bring their kids to the office,?? WeWork's Japan head, Chris Hill, said in an interview. ??Part of our global vision is to create workspaces that are conducive to having more mothers and women enter the workforce.??While pets are already a feature at the startup's locations from London to New York, they're unheard of in Japan, where offices tend to be cramped, quiet, and overrun with paper documents.But it is the focus on childcare that strikes a deeper nerve in a country struggling to provide enough daycare. Facing a labor shortage exacerbated by an aging and shrinking population, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying to boost female participation in the workforce. Yet one of the biggest barriers facing new mothers is a lack of facilities.??We will put funds in place to resolve the urgent problem of childcare waiting lists,?? Abe said in November. Recent increases in supply of care facilities are still falling short of demand, particularly in large cities, as the government urges companies to provide more such facilities for workers.So far that includes Tokyo employees of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and local companies such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Line Corp., who provide on-site daycare at some of their offices.Japan&apos;s pet population outnumbers kids Source: Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan Pet Food AssociationWeWork's first location is opening in Ark Hills in southwest Tokyo on February 1, and Hill expects it to be at full capacity.

Fired Tech Workers Turn to Chatbots for Counseling,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/fired-indian-tech-workers-turn-to-chatbots-for-counseling,"December 10, 2017, 3:30 PM EST",technology,,"For months Lovkesh Joshi was quietly terrified of losing?his job as a manager at a top Indian tech services company. Clients were cutting their budgets, prompting his bosses to fire dozens of?colleagues.?His manager told him not to worry, but it was hard not to when experts were predicting that millions of the country's IT workers would be eliminated in the coming years. ??My head was full of ??yaar, kya honewalla hai?,&apos;?? says Joshi, using a Hindi?expression that means ??what's going to happen???Joshi didn't want to burden his wife or friends so he turned to a chatbot?therapist called Wysa. Powered by artificial intelligence, the app promises to be???loyal, supportive and very private,?? and encourages users to divulge their feelings about a recent major event or big change in their lives. ??I could open up and talk,?? says the 41-year-old father of two school-age children, who says his conversations with the bot flowed naturally. ??I felt heard and understood.?? Joshi?moved to a large rival outsourcer two months ago.The upheaval in India's $154 billion tech outsourcing industry has prompted thousands of Indians?to seek solace in online therapy services. People?accustomed to holding down prestigious jobs and pulling in handsome salaries are losing out to automation, a shift away from long-term legacy contracts and curbs on U.S. work visas. McKinsey & Co says almost half of? the four million people working in India's IT services industry?will become ??irrelevant?? in the next three to four years.??Indians, like people the world over, tend to hide their mental anguish for fear of being stigmatized. That's why many are embracing the convenience, anonymity and affordability of online counseling startups, most of which?use human therapists.????Online mental health platforms are powerful, and real-time counseling can segue into a solution,?? says?Mridul Arora, a managing director at SAIF Partners,?a venture capital firm that backed a startup called?YourDOST. ??Any new service needs early adopters and who better than young, tech-savvy IT professionals???YourDOST's founders suffered their own career-related stress on their way up. Despite attending a top engineering college and acing his computer science? courses, Puneet Manuja?couldn't find a job right away and was rejected by half-a-dozen companies including Yahoo! and Adobe during campus placements. Manuja's classmates poked fun at him and he couldn't share the agony with his parents or friends. Meanwhile, Richa Singh, who later became his wife and partner, was struggling with the suicide of a friend afraid she wouldn't be hired during campus placement.When the pair met years later at a global technology firm, they shared their experiences and talked about doing something to help those with depression and stress. YourDOST (dost means friend in Hindi) began as a blog, but the pair decided they needed to do something for people afraid to seek?face-to-face counseling. The duo quit their jobs and set up a digital platform that offers?counseling from a network of psychologists and psychiatrists.?Where face-to-face therapy can cost thousands of rupees, YourDOST?audio chats cost?400 rupees ($6.20) and video chats 600 rupees. Help is available 24/7, and the startup currently offers over 2,000 counseling sessions daily.This summer, at the height of the outsourcing job losses,?YourDOST?also set up a toll-free helpline?to comfort and advise anonymous callers. Senior psychologist Sushma Hebbar says job loss in the male-dominated industry???is not just an economic defeat but a status loss too.?? Men break down during the counseling, and weepy students berate themselves for choosing engineering as a career path. They incessantly ask: how can I pull myself together and save my job? One young woman who lost her job now fakes her office routine so her parents don't find out. A male engineer dismissed weeks before his wedding?couldn't bear to tell his future father-in-law.YourDOST?career coach Aditya Sisodia helps fired workers reinvent themselves. ??The IT industry slowdown is stressing everyone between 15 and 55 years,?? he says. Employees saddled with mortgages, car loans and kids' student loans struggle to reconcile to the ??new normal.??Another husband-and-wife team, Ramakant Vempati and Jo Aggarwal, unveiled Wysa this January. The chatbot?uses natural language processing?to understand and classify conversations, then responds with compassionate solutions framed by therapists. The founders consciously stayed away from replicating quick-fix solutions offered in self-help books or the therapist's couch approach. ??The chatbot provides an empathic ear, listens without judgment and guides them to the positive,?? Aggarwal says. ??The conversations feel natural and real.?? All counseling sessions are anonymous and free; the company makes money by licensing its AI technology to enterprise customers, global insurers and healthcare providers.Last month, Wysa's founders conducted a?quarterly review of chatbot content and discovered that chats related to job losses and work had become the second most popular topic.Dinesh Kumaramangalam?had spent more than three years remotely managing client systems at a small IT services company when he was dismissed this summer. The client's projects had been automated and his 300-strong team was whittled down to 70. The 38-year-old was aghast and worried for his wife and six-year-old daughter. His parents who live with him constantly doled out advice. When a relative suggested he seek help through an online counseling service called the Juno Clinic, he demurred.But after several months fruitlessly looking??looking for work, Kumaramangalam decided he had nothing to lose by reaching out to Juno Clinic. Set up by three entrepreneurs who had all spent a major portion of their careers in the outsourcing industry, the startup began offering online counseling sessions to users last year. Its online chats are free while users are charged?for audio and video chats.?Juno, which is based in Mumbai,?created special packages for fired employees. Its 28 therapists are trained in handling such callers. ??Intervention is very important, or work-related anxiety and depression could quickly spiral into something worse,????says?co-founder Davesh Manocha.Kumaramangalam?was angry when he started counseling. ??I worked really hard,?? he says.???I should've been one of the 70 who got to stay.?? Talking to the counselor helped him get over his frustration and frame better responses at job interviews. After seven 800-rupee-an-hour counseling sessions via phone calls and and Skype video, the engineer finally landed a job six weeks ago. ??It is a smaller IT services company, almost a startup, and I had to take a salary cut.??"

Also joining the e-commerce giant as partners are Pizza Hut, Uber Technologies Inc., Mazda Motor Corp. and Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing.Toyota e-Palette concept vehicle??It's my goal to transition Toyota from an automobile company to a mobility company, and the possibilities of what we can build, in my mind, are endless,?? Akio Toyoda, the automaker's president, said on stage Monday at CES in Las Vegas.Toyota's news comes as major car manufacturers and tech giants gather this week at the event, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show, to showcase whole suites of products meant to overhaul human mobility. Auto companies from General Motors Co. to Tesla Inc. as well as interlopers like Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo are racing to bring fully self-driving cars to market, and the payoff will be massive for the ones who pull it off first.Read more: A user's guide to the dawn of robot drivingToyota's vehicle unveiled at CES -- called the e?\Palette concept -- will come in three sizes and sport open interior layouts with flat floors to allow users to outfit them according to their needs. The larger vehicles resemble small buses and allow adults to stand up inside. The company suggested they could even be reconfigured as mobile hotel rooms.??We're constantly looking for ways to innovate and help improve our logistics operations, and in this partnership with Toyota we'll collaborate and explore new opportunities to improve the speed and quality of delivery for our customers,?? Tim Collins, vice president of Amazon Logistics, said in an emailed statement.In the near term, the alliance will focus on developing the battery-electric e-Palette, which will have an open?\source control interface that allows partner companies to install their own automated driving systems instead of Toyota's, if desired. In addition, Toyota will provide an array of services to help e-Palette customers use their vehicles, including leasing and insurance support and fleet management. Users will also have access to its global communications network and a so-called Toyota Big Data Center.??What's unique about our system is we offer all the software, all the hardware and all the financial tools you would need to run mobility as a service, soup to nuts,?? Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said. The process is intended to be cashless, allowing users to make payments automatically once they've gained access to the vehicles with smart keys or a facial recognition system.Pizza Hut, a Yum! Brands Inc.-owned chain that built its reputation on sit-down pizza service, said its partnership with Toyota could help it deliver more pizza faster, with driverless cars potentially helping during particularly busy times, like Super Bowl Sunday.Even though driverless delivery is still a few years off, the tie-up with Toyota could make the company's delivery system safer and more efficient by analyzing driver data, according to Artie Starrs, who runs Pizza Hut's U.S. operation.The largest of the three major pizza chains in the U.S., Pizza Hut has lagged behind its rivals on technology and struggled to shed its roots as a sit-down dining destination in an industry where delivery is king.??It's an incredibly symbiotic relationship,?? Starrs said. ??This reinforces Pizza Hut as a delivery-centric brand.??Toyota is not alone in exploring such concepts. Ford Motor Co. conducted a test this past fall with Domino's Pizza Inc. to gauge consumer appetite for driverless-pizza delivery. Nissan Motor Co. plans to unveil?at the Hanover Motor Show in Germany in September a driverless van that can transfer packages from central warehouses to surrounding homes. GM plans to have its self-driving cars ready for a ride-share service next year.??They've been in a ??wait and see' mode while other companies including Volkswagen, Daimler, Ford and General Motors have been making big commitments in the mobility-as-a-service space,???Mike Ramsey, a transportation analyst with researcher Gartner Inc., said of Toyota. ??With this announcement, Toyota in joining the fray in a more direct way.??Toyota has small stakes in launch partners Uber and Mazda and is already seeking additional partners to either utilize the self-driving vehicles or help develop the technology. Didi, the only China-based company joining the alliance, will cooperate globally with Toyota, according to an emailed statement.For more on self-driving trucks, check out the Decrypted podcast:??It's a general rule when you're the very best at the old order, then you're probably the last guy to sign onto the new order,?? Jim Womack, founder of the Lean Enterprise Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said of Toyota. ??Akio's got his head in the game now.??Toyoda, 61, is a scion of Toyota's founding family who's served as president of the carmaker since 2009. He's said frequently the company needs to accelerate the pace of its technological innovations. He's also said that since Toyota can't create the future of mobility all by itself, it needs to get better at creating partnerships, even with companies like Amazon, which he cited in August as a potential competitor.??While I do believe in healthy competition, I'm less concerned about getting there first as I am about getting it right and about finding ways to use technology to benefit as many as possible,?? Toyoda said in Las Vegas. ??For me, e-Palette is one such example.??The automaker plans to have the self-driving fleets available at Tokyo's 2020 Olympic Games.

What the World's Central Banks Are Saying About Bitcoin,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/what-the-world-s-central-banks-are-saying-about-cryptocurrencies,"December 14, 2017, 9:53 PM EST",technology,,"Nine years since the birth of?Bitcoin, central banks around the world are increasingly recognizing the potential upsides -- and downsides -- of?digital currencies.The guardians of the global economy have two sets of issues to address. First is what to do, if anything, about the growth of the private cryptocurrencies that are grabbing more and more attention for a host of reasons: security concerns after a $500 million exchange hack in Japan, volatile price moves and -- in the case of Bitcoin, at least -- their introduction on regulated derivatives exchanges. The second question is whether to issue official versions.Here's a wrap-up of how the the world's largest central banks (and some smaller ones) are approaching the crypto phenomenon:The Federal Reserve's investigation into cryptocurrencies is in its early days, and policy makers haven't been overtly enthusiastic about the idea of a central-bank issued answer to Bitcoin.?Newly installed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in 2017 that technical issues with the technology remain and ??governance and risk management will be critical.?? Powell said there are ??meaningful?? challenges to a central-bank cryptocurrency, that privacy issues could be a problem, and private-sector alternatives may do the job.Cryptocurrencies have seen ??extreme volatility?? but it remains less clear if they pose a threat to financial stability, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in April. Randal Quarles, vice chair for supervision at the Fed, said Dec. 1 while the central bank of the world's biggest economy has no policy toward regulation of Bitcoin, it is ??worth thinking about.?? The volume of cryptocurrencies could matter to monetary policy at some point, Powell said in answering a question at his Senate confirmation hearing in November. Right now, though, ??they're just not big enough,?? he said.The Swiss National Bank said in February it isn't planning to issue a digital version of the franc and sees the potential for such a currency to have an ill effect on the financial system, according to Vice President Fritz Zurbruegg. ??Would broad access to a CBDC or broader access to digital central bank money have better results than the current monetary system? And would the Swiss National Bank thereby better fulfill its legal mandate? From our perspective it's a no to both questions,?? he said at a conference in Germany.The European Central Bank has repeatedly warned about the dangers of investing in digital currencies. ECB President Mario Draghi said in February the blockchain was ??quite promising?? and the bank is ??very interested?? in the technology. Draghi doesn't consider Bitcoin a currency however as it's too volatile. Vice President Vitor Constancio said in September that Bitcoin isn't a currency, but a ??tulip?? -- alluding to the 17th-century bubble in the Netherlands.Even when compared to some of history's biggest bubbles, Bitcoin is wild: read moreChina has made it clear: the central bank has full control over cryptocurrencies.?With a research team set up in 2014 to develop digital fiat money, the People's Bank of China?believes ??conditions are ripe?? for it to embrace the technology. But at the same time, the authorities are cracking down on Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency trading.?The PBOC's Deputy Governor Fan Yifei said at the end of March the central bank will regulate virtual currencies in 2018, while not giving a timetable for the issuance of its own digital currency.Cash is still king in Japan, according to the head of the central bank's FinTech Center. The Bank of Japan is not considering issuing a digital currency as there is ??no demand?? for it, Yuko Kawai said in January, noting the rise of cashless transactions remains a work in progress in the country. Authorities may be forced to take action on the sector, however, after nearly $500 million in digital tokens was stolen from the Coincheck Inc. exchange in Tokyo on Jan. 26.BOJ chief Haruhiko Kuroda said?in December of Bitcoin that ??if it's a question of whether it's functioning like currencies as a form of payment or means of settlement, I don't think it is.?? Bitcoin ??is being traded for investing or for speculation,?? he said. The central bank also released a Q&A in April raising awareness with the general public about risks of investing in cryptocurrencies.Germans for the first time made less than half their transactions using cash, a significant development for a country with a longstanding fondness for physical money. Yet Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said changes to consumer behavior will be gradual -- and he doesn't consider the ??Bitcoin hype?? as competition for traditional cash or bank deposits for the foreseeable future. ??For a stable monetary and financial system, we do not need crypto-tokens, but central banks committed to price stability and effective bank regulation,?? he said in February. ??We have both in the euro area.??Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, in his capacity as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, warned in a March letter to G-20 finance leaders the rapid evolution of crypto-assets may one day make them a threat to the financial system. Carney has also cited cryptocurrencies as part of a potential ??revolution?? in finance. The central bank started a financial technology accelerator in 2016, a?Silicon Valley practice aimed at incubating young companies.Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said at a fintech conference in January Bitcoin was a ??purely speculative asset?? and the G-20 countries need to study the issue. ??We need to be clear: bitcoin is in no way a currency, or even a crypto-currency,?? the governor added in a December speech in Beijing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's February budget specifically targeted cryptocurrencies. While the government is considering the use of blockchain technology to organize records, it doesn't consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender and will take all measures to eliminate their use in financing. India's central bank is opposed to cryptocurrencies given that they can be a channel for money laundering and terrorist financing.The Monetary Authority of Singapore is closely studying developments and potential risks in the crypto space but currently sees no strong case to ban trading, Deputy Prime Minister and MAS Chairman Tharman Shanmugaratnam said in a February response to questions from parliament. Ravi Menon, MAS managing director, said in March the authority will ??never say never?? on cryptocurrencies becoming money. MAS has experimented with digital Singapore dollars on the blockchain and is collaborating with the Bank of Canada on a cross-border solution using tokens issued by central banks.Ilan Goldfajn, President of Brazil's central bank, said in March cryptocurrencies don't offer stability and while they aren't a systematic risk they need to be monitored. ??We are giving an alert,?? he said. The Banco Central do Brasil sees ??no immediate risk for the Brazilian financial system?? from cryptocurrencies, but remains alert to the developments in their usage, according to a statement issued in November.Carolyn Wilkins, the Bank of Canada's senior deputy governor, is leading research on cryptocurrencies, and said in March it's important to define crypto assets ??before the toothpaste gets out of the tube.?? Countries need to come up with consistent definitions to avoid any cross-border regulatory arbitrage. BOC staff are also exploring the circumstances under which it might be appropriate for the bank to issue its own digital currency for retail transactions.Authorities in South Korea have focused on protecting consumers and preventing cryptocurrencies from being used as a tool of crime. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol told lawmakers in a March parliamentary hearing that cryptocurrencies are far from becoming legal tender, and as such regulations to protect consumers and prevent illegal trading are necessary. A task force within the BOK has been conducting studies on cryptocurrencies since January, he said.Russia's central bank has expressed concern over potential risks from digital currencies, with Governor Elvira Nabiullina saying ??we don't legalize pyramid schemes?? and ??we are totally opposed to private money, no matter if it is in physical or virtual form.?? However, the central bank also announced plans to use blockchain technology for electronic collateral, guarantees and letters of credit, First Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said in February.Australia's central bank chief criticized cryptocurrencies in a speech in Sydney Dec. 13, arguing the asset is more likely to appeal to criminals than consumers. ??The current fascination with these currencies feels more like a speculative mania than it has to do with their use as an efficient and convenient form of electronic payment,?? said Philip Lowe, the Reserve Bank of Australia's governor. The bank is not planning to issue its own digital currency as a case hasn't been made to do so, Lowe said. The RBA is in close contact with its peers in other countries and few see electronic banknotes on the horizon, he said.Digital currencies may contribute to financial stability if designed well, Turkish Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya said in Istanbul in November. But they do pose new risks to central banks, including?to their control of money supply and price stability, and the transmission of monetary policy, Cetinkaya said. Even so, the Turkish central banker said that cryptocurrencies may be an important element for a cashless economy, and the technologies used can help speed up and make payment systems more efficient.The Dutch have been among the most daring when it comes to experimenting with digital currencies. In 2015 the central bank created its own cryptocurrency called DNBcoin -- for internal circulation only -- to better understand how it works. In a January position paper, the central bank said the speculative nature of crypto assets is a cause for concern. The experiments confirmed the technology is ??too slow?? and underdeveloped currently to play a role in payment systems, but may have applications in the future.Like the Dutch, some Nordic authorities have been keen to explore the idea of digital cash. Sweden's Riksbank, the world's oldest central bank, is probing options including a digital register-based e-krona, with balances in central-database accounts or with values stored in an app or on a card. The bank says the introduction of an e-krona poses ??no major obstacles?? to monetary policy. As of March, that project is still underway and no decision has been made on issuing e-kronas, the central bank said.In an environment where the use of cash is decreasing, Norway's Norges Bank is?looking at? possibilities such as individual accounts at the central bank, plastic cards or an app to use for payments, it said in a May report.?Denmark has backtracked somewhat on its initial enthusiasm, with Deputy Governor Per Callesen cautioning against central banks offering digital currencies directly to consumers. One argument is that such direct access to central bank liquidity could contribute to runs on commercial banks?in times of crisis.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's former acting governor Grant Spencer, who vacated the role in March, warned that Bitcoin's runaway gains look like a speculative bubble. ??Digital currencies, cryptocurrencies, are a real and serious proposition for the future,???Spencer said in a Dec. 10 interview with TVNZ. ??I think they are part of the future, but not the sort that we see in Bitcoin.?? The central bank, once a pioneer on the global stage with its early introduction of inflation targeting, said in?an analytical note in November that it's considering future plans for currency issuance and how digital units may fit into those strategies.In one of the more strident reactions, Morocco has deemed that all transactions involving virtual currencies violate exchange regulations and are punishable by law. Cryptocurrencies amount to a hidden payment system not backed by any institution and involve significant risks for their users, authorities said in a?statement in November.The central bank for central banks warned in a March report that while digital currencies are a revolutionary tool, they remain far too risky to be used as legal tender any time soon. Central banks could one day use digital currency for tasks such as settling payments among financial institutions, but if issued to the general public they may destabilize traditional lenders.There is a ??strong case?? for authorities to rein in digital currencies to safeguard the ??real value?? of money, Agustin Carstens, head of the BIS, said in a February speech.??

Somewhere, Satoshi Nakamoto is smiling.After all, avoiding bank and government oversight, and sidestepping the eroding effects of inflation, was what Nakamoto had in mind when he (or she, or they) created bitcoin in 2008.Peer-to-peer bitcoin trading?in major developing nations outpaced the U.S., the world's biggest market, according to data from LocalBitcoins.?Demand surged in China and Russia, where central banks put a stop to local exchange trading; in Venezuela, where authorities cracked down on bitcoin mining even as hyperinflation drove up demand; and in Brazil and Colombia, where citizens heard dire warnings of cryptocurrencies' risks.??The strong interest from emerging-market countries could be reflective of relatively less stable local currencies or a byproduct of greater exposure to financial and economic crises that makes an alternative system like bitcoin relatively appealing,?? Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital LLC in San Francisco said.Cryptocurrencies don't rely on central banks or financial institutions and are traded on online exchanges and transferred anywhere in the world, allowing holders to skirt currency controls. Bitcoin's creators also set a limit to the amount of currency that could be created to avoid the inflation that ensues when central banks print money.In China, where regulators closed local exchange operations, peer-to-peer trading rose more than 2,000 percent in dollar terms this year, and in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin warned the use of digital currencies bears ??serious risks,?? it increased by almost 200 percent. Meantime, it grew by about 20 percent in the U.S.Bitcoin landed on Wall Street this week, with the launch of futures on?Cboe Global Markets Inc.'s exchange, as the 1,700 percent surge in the world's most popular cryptocurrency this year has captivated everyone from mom-and-pop speculators to trading firms. Similar futures will start trading Dec. 17 at CME Group Inc.'s exchange.Bitcoin rose 0.4 percent to $16,825.9 as of 8:03 a.m. in New York.Google Trends data also hints at growing interest from emerging-market users, according to Bogart. Five out of the six countries where ??bitcoin?? has the most search interest are developing nations, he says.Nigeria, which sits atop the Trends' list, saw peer-to-peer transactions rise almost 1,500 percent this year, as the country went through a foreign exchange market overhaul that led the naira to weaken 12.4 percent this year.?An almost 1,000 percent rise came in Venezuela, where bitcoin provided a way to skirt the government's tightening controls on access to U.S. dollars?and spiraling inflation that slashes the value of the bolivar.Trading volume in such places remains a fraction of larger markets, even after such explosive growth, amounting to about $115 million in Nigeria and $50 million in Venezuela. Global trading stood at $1.9 billion last year, according to LocalBitcoins.Emerging markets' share of total trading volume in LocalBitcoins is increasing. China and Russia combined account for about 40 percent of the market.Read more: Bitcoin Love Spreads to Latin America's Richest With New FundsSurging demand has created price discrepancies. One bitcoin in NairaEx, a local Nigerian exchange, cost 7,230,098 nairas as of Dec. 12. Converted to dollars, the cryptocurrency was more than 15 percent more expensive than a bitcoin in the U.S.?Prices were also higher at local exchanges in Russia and Argentina than in the U.S., while they were cheaper in Colombia, Singapore and Brazil.While not all central banks in emerging markets addressed cryptocurrency markets with regulations, several have issued warnings.?Brazil's central bank last month said in a statement, ??they are neither issued nor guaranteed by any monetary authority?? and therefore, ??there is no guarantee that they can be converted to a sovereign currency and they are not backed by any kind of real asset.?? Peer-to-peer trading in Latin America's largest economy rose 450 percent this year.?While Colombia's central bank has also said virtual currencies aren't recognized by authorities and bring risks to financial stability,?the peso has weakened more than 3 percent in the past three months, increasing cryptocurrencies' allure. Turkey and India have also cautioned bitcoin users.Of course, it's not necessarily true that strict regulation is driving demand for cryptocurrencies. It could be the demand came first, thanks to high inflation or long-standing limits on taking cash abroad, and that motivated people to buy bitcoin. Then came the crackdown.?The surge in bitcoin demand ??should at least raise some eyebrows,?? given that it doesn't have the backing of a state and isn't legal tender, said Agustin Carstens, a general manager at the Bank for International Settlements, and former governor of Mexico's central bank.?Simon Quijano-Evans, an emerging-market strategist at Legal & General Investment Management Ltd., wrote in a note in early December that emerging-market central banks must quickly deal with the rise of virtual currencies.??Cryptocurrencies stand as a potential challenge to the millennia of confidence-building measures that have gone into the construction of fiat currency,?? he wrote."

The trial begins on Monday.Lawyers agreed before the process started that jurors would be excused for having strong opinions about either company and certain witnesses. About a dozen were dismissed for this reason, after signaling their opinions on a questionnaire. The responses to the questionnaire weren't made public, but U.S. District Judge William Alsup said only one of the opinions that led to a dismissal was a positive one.One prospective juror was dismissed because he held stock in Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc. The group who made the jury include a home health-care provider, an AT&T lineman, a citizen from the former Soviet Republic with a background in mechanical engineering, an optician, an accountant for a women's clothier and a former U.S. Air Force radar trouble-shooter who now works for the Veteran's Administration."

Menlo Park, California-based Facebook shifted its international business operations to Ireland in 2010.Facebook has since come under pressure from the U.S. and Europe for its tax practices. Last year, the company said it would stop routing U.K. sales through Ireland after public outcry over news that Facebook paid only 4,327 pounds ($6,128) in taxes in 2014. In the U.S., the company is locked in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that may cost it more than $5 billion, plus interest and penalties, related to global operations that are reported by the Irish unit.??We believe that moving to a local selling structure will provide more transparency to governments and policy makers around the world who have called for greater visibility over the revenue associated with locally supported sales in their countries,?? Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner wrote Tuesday in a statement.The European Commission is looking into ways to tax digital companies like Facebook as it seeks to raise money from an industry that the commission says provides less tax than it should. The Commission also has ordered Apple Inc. to pay about 13 billion euros (about $15 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, after it said the country granted unfair deals that reduced the tech giant's corporate tax bill. Apple and Ireland are appealing the ruling.Facebook's announcement is an ??important change that is a step in the right direction,?? the Italian Treasury said in a statement.Wehner said Facebook plans to implement the change through 2018 with a goal of switching all its offices to the new structure by the first half of 2019. The company has more than 30 international offices. Facebook said it will keep its U.S. headquarters in Menlo Park and Dublin will continue to be the international hub.??

The Mysterious Twitter User Drawing a Swarm of Japan Traders,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-14/the-mysterious-twitter-user-attracting-a-swarm-of-japan-traders,"January 14, 2018, 11:00 AM EST",business,"""Tweets by the anonymous Okasanman are ‘crucial' for traders"", ""Prolific tweeter has more followers than the Bank of Japan""","On a day when billions in profits and losses would be determined by split-second trades,?the salaried professionals of Japan's financial markets were glued to their news terminals. Another group was staring at the feed of an anonymous Twitter account.It was shortly after noon on Jan. 29, 2016, and people with money at stake were waiting for the Bank of Japan to announce its monetary policy. While the decision's date is set in advance, nobody knows its timing.Okasanman's Twitter account.??It's a negative interest rate bazooka!?? wrote the Twitter user who goes by the handle Okasanman, attaching a screenshot of an article just published on a local news website, showing the BOJ was discussing introducing minus rates as its latest shock-and-awe stimulus weapon.As stock futures jumped and the yen tumbled, some traders expressed gratitude for the warning.?About 15 minutes later, the bank said it was taking borrowing costs below zero.??This post saved my life,"" one user gushed in reply. ??The profits I made are thanks to it.??Okasanman has been dubbed a ??locust lord?? because the account attracts a swarm of traders who seek to profit from the prolific tweets on everything from global economic data releases to the latest twists in developing political situations.?While the account only points to already available information, the speed at which it does -- and the breadth of its coverage -- has built a following that's larger than that of the BOJ.""How is it so fast?"" asked Hajime Sakai, chief fund manager at Mito Securities Co. in Tokyo, where he helps oversee $594 million. ""I'm very curious to know.""Okasanman's identity and motivation for spending hours every day providing information to?more than 146,000 followers -- as of the time of publication -- for free are a mystery. The person or people behind the handle didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. But the account is another example of how microbloggers -- from?anonymous short sellers to market commentators such as Zerohedge -- are becoming a feature of how information is transmitted through modern financial markets.The Okasanman account scavenges through a huge range of sources, at all hours, to find potentially market-moving news. That includes newspapers and magazines, financial data providers, disclosures to the stock exchange, and tweets on accidents or fires. Many appear to be automated, though manually written commentary shows a love of groan-worthy puns and occasionally crude content.In August, the account was among the first to tweet an exclusive report by a local magazine, not normally known for its market-moving scoops, that pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca Plc had made an unsuccessful takeover bid for Japanese drug company Daiichi Sankyo Co. -- and that a purchase was still possible. Daiichi Sankyo shares surged the most in nine years.??His tweets are absolutely crucial,"" said Naoki Murakami, a prominent day trader with more than 38,000?followers himself.On any given day, the tweeting is relentless. On Dec. 20, the account sent 111 tweets, starting 12:44 a.m. and ending at 11:46 p.m. Cryptocurrencies: 33 tweets. The U.S. Senate vote on the tax bill: 3. Other topics included a disgraced sumo wrestler, a report on North Korean ICBM tests, and the latest Pokemon movie.Okasanman ??must have researched what sources have been fastest over the years?? for given topics,?said Katsuhiro Yoneshige, founder and chief executive officer of JX Press Corp., which develops apps that source breaking news from social media posts. ??It's probably not something you can build in a day.??Little is known about Okasanman. There's the profile picture: a cartoon man in a yellow safety helmet. There's the profile description. Work: IT-related, investor, day trader. Interests: music (Japanese singers and bands), movies (cult and science fiction), psychology and languages (English and Finnish). ??Live market commentary from 12:30 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. every weekday,?? it says. ??A pretext for a gag-fest.??And that's it, apart from the occasional hint among the tweets. Okasanman seems to live in an unfashionable residential area just outside Tokyo and appears to own a cat. But is it a man or woman? And is it run by a single person, or multiple Okasanmen?""I think he might be a bit older,"" says Yoneshige, who at 29 says some of Okasanman's cultural references are from before his time. The language used, as well as a taste for dad jokes and an obsession with Ivanka Trump, would seem to point to a middle-aged man, but Bloomberg News was unable to speak with anyone who could confirm who Okasanman is. The first autocomplete suggestion in a Google search for Okasanman is ""identity.??The only interaction Bloomberg News was able to secure with him for this article was when it was published. Following its release, he retweeted the story in typical dissembling style. ""Even if you follow this account, only your puns will improve,"" he joked, referring to his own account. Okasan Securities Group Inc., a mid-tier Japanese brokerage house, says it has nothing to do with the account.The motives are also unclear: why go to so much effort to provide the information for free? There seems to be no attempt to monetize the feed, or tweets that might be supplied by sponsors.Not everyone is that impressed. ""I've never really imagined what he could be like,"" says perhaps Japan's most-famous tweeting day trader, who goes by the handle?Cis. ""He tweets news really fast. That's my only impression.""But one thing is certain: Okasanman's influence has grown so much that the account can cause confusion when it indulges in the occasional prank, such as a tweet in November 2016.??Kuroda to hold emergency press conference on resignation,?? it said.Coming after almost a year of criticism of the Bank of Japan's negative rate policy, many followers took this to be a reference to BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. Two minutes later, Okasanman clarified: It was Hiroki Kuroda, former pitcher for the baseball team Hiroshima Carp.?? With assistance by Min Jeong Lee, Stephen Stapczynski, and Jason Clenfield"
??It Can't Be True.' Inside the Semiconductor Industry's Meltdown,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-08/-it-can-t-be-true-inside-the-semiconductor-industry-s-meltdown,"January 8, 2018, 6:00 AM EST",technology,"""Technology titans work in secrecy for months to fix key flaws"", ""Researchers uncover security holes too big to believe""","It was late November and former Intel Corp. engineer Thomas Prescher was enjoying beers and burgers with friends in Dresden, Germany, when the conversation turned, ominously, to semiconductors.?Months earlier, cybersecurity researcher Anders Fogh had posted a blog suggesting a possible way to hack into chips powering most of the world's computers, and the friends spent part of the evening trying to make sense of it. The idea nagged at Prescher, so when he got home he fired up his desktop computer and set about putting the theory into practice. At 2 a.m., a breakthrough: he'd strung together code that reinforced Fogh's idea and suggested there was something seriously wrong.??My immediate reaction was, ??It can't be true, it can't be true,'?? Prescher said.Last week, his worst fears were proved right when Intel, one of the world's largest chipmakers, said all modern processors?can be attacked by techniques dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, exposing crucial data, such as passwords and encryption keys. The biggest technology companies, including Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Google and Amazon.com Inc. are rushing out fixes for PCs, smartphones and the servers that power the internet, and some have warned that their solutions may dent performance in some cases.Prescher was one of at least 10 researchers and engineers working around the globe -- sometimes independently, sometimes together -- who uncovered Meltdown and Spectre. Interviews with several of these experts reveal a chip industry?that, while talking up efforts to secure computers, failed to spot that a common feature of their products had made machines so vulnerable.""It makes you shudder,"" said?Paul Kocher,?who helped find Spectre and started studying trade-offs between security and performance after leaving a full-time job at chip company Rambus Inc. last year. ""The processor people were looking at performance and not looking at security."" Kocher still works as an adviser to Rambus. All processor makers have tried to speed up the way chips crunch data and run programs by making them guess. Using speculative execution, the microprocessor fetches data it predicts it's going to need next.Spectre fools the processor into running speculative operations -- ones it wouldn't normally perform -- and then uses information about how long the hardware takes to retrieve the data to infer the details of that information. Meltdown exposes data directly by undermining the way information in different applications is kept separate by what's known as a kernel, the?key software at the core of every computer.Researchers began writing about the potential for security weaknesses at the heart of central processing units, or CPUs, at least as early as 2005. Yuval Yarom, at the University of Adelaide in Australia, credited with helping discover Spectre last week, penned some of this early work.QuickTake Q&A: All About That Big Chip Security WeaknessBy 2013, other research papers showed that CPUs let unauthorized users see the layout of the kernel, a set of instructions that guide how computers perform key tasks like?managing files and security and allocating resources. This vulnerability became known as a KASLR break and was the foundation for some of last week's revelations.In 2016, research by Felix Wilhelm and others demonstrated how an early version of speculative execution could make chips vulnerable to data leaks. Jann Horn, a young Google researcher credited with first reporting the Meltdown and Spectre weaknesses, was inspired by some of this work, according to a recent tweet.Graz team members Michael Schwarz, from left, Moritz Lipp, and Daniel GrussAt?Black Hat USA, a major cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas, in August 2016 a team from Graz Technical University presented their research from earlier in the year on a way to prevent attacks against the kernel memory of Intel chips. One of the group, Daniel Gruss, shared a hotel room with Fogh, a malware researcher at G Data Advanced Analytics, an IT security consulting firm. Fogh had long been interested in ""side-channel"" attacks, ways to use the structure of chips to force computers to reveal data.?Fogh and Gruss stayed up late at night discussing the theoretical basis for what would later become Spectre and Meltdown. But, like Prescher more than a year later, the Graz team was skeptical this was a real flaw. Gruss recalls telling Fogh that the chipmakers would have uncovered such a glaring security hole during testing and would never have shipped chips with a vulnerability like that.Fogh made the case again at Black Hat Europe, in early November 2016 in London, this time to Graz researcher Michael Schwarz. The two discussed how side-channel attacks might overcome the security of ""virtualized"" computing, where single servers are sliced up into what looks, to users, like multiple machines. This is a key part of increasingly popular cloud services. It's supposed to be secure because each virtual computing session is designed to keep different customers' information separate even when it's on the same server.Despite Fogh's encouragement, the Graz researchers still didn't think attacks would ever work in practice. ""That would be such a major f*ck-up by Intel that it can't be possible,""?Schwarz recalled saying. So the team didn't dedicate much time to it.Cybersecurity researchers from across the world teamed up to lay out the extent of the flawNote: Fogh was not part of the team that worked on the Meltdown and Spectre papers.In January 2017, Fogh said he finally made the connection to speculative execution and how it could be used to attack the kernel. He mentioned his findings at an industry conference on Jan. 12, and in March he pitched the idea to the Graz team.By the middle of the year, the Graz researchers had developed a software security patch they called KAISER that was designed to fix the KASLR break. It was made for Linux, the world's most popular open-source operating system. Linux controls servers -- making it important for corporate computing -- and also supports the Android operating system used by the majority of mobile devices. Being open source, all suggested Linux updates must be shared publicly, and KAISER was well received by the developer community. The researchers did not know it then, but their patch would turn out to help prevent Meltdown attacks.Fogh published his blog on July 28 detailing efforts to use a Meltdown-style attack to steal information from a real computer running real software. He failed, again fueling doubts among other researchers that the vulnerabilities could really be used to steal data from chips. Fogh also mentioned unfinished work on what would become Spectre, calling it ""Pandora's Box."" That got little reaction, too.The Graz team's attitude quickly changed, though, as summer turned to fall. They noticed a spike in programming activity on their KAISER patch from researchers at Google, Amazon and Microsoft. These giants were pitching updates and trying to persuade the Linux community to accept them -- without being open about their reasons sometimes.??That made it a bit suspicious,?? Schwarz said. Developers submitting specific Linux updates usually say why they're proposing changes, ""and on some of the things they didn't explain. We wondered why these people were investing so much time and were working on it so hard to integrate it into Linux at any cost.""To Schwarz and his fellow researchers, there was only one explanation: A potentially much bigger attack method that could blow open these vulnerabilities, and the tech giants were scrambling to fix it secretly before every malicious hacker on Earth found out.Unbeknownst to the Graz team and Fogh, a 22-year-old wunderkind at Alphabet Inc.'s Google called Jann Horn had independently discovered Spectre and Meltdown in April. He's part of Google's Project Zero, a team of crack security researchers tasked with finding ""zero-day"" security holes -- vulnerabilities that trigger attacks on the first day they become known.On June 1, Horn told Intel and other chip companies Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and ARM Holdings what he'd found. Intel informed Microsoft soon after. That's when the big tech companies began working on fixes, including Graz's KAISER patch, in private.By November, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, ARM and Oracle Corp. were submitting so many of their own Linux updates to the community that more cybersecurity researchers began to realize something big -- and strange -- was happening.Tests on the patches these tech giants were advocating showed serious implications for the performance of key computer systems. In one case, Amazon found that a patch increased the time it took to run certain operations by about 400 percent, and yet the cloud leader was still lobbying that every Linux user ought to take the fix, according to Gruss. He said this made no sense for their original KAISER patch, which would only ever impact a small sub-section of users.?Gruss and other researchers became more suspicious that these companies weren't being completely honest about the rationale for their proposals. Intel said it is standard practice not to disclose vulnerabilities until a full remedy has been put in place. The chipmaker and other tech companies have also said their tests show minimal or no impact on performance, although certain unusual workloads may be slowed by as much as 30 percent.In late November, another team of researchers at IT firm Cyberus Technology became convinced that Intel had been telling its main clients, such as Amazon and Microsoft, all about the issue, while keeping the full scale of the crisis hidden from Linux development groups.?Prescher, the former Intel engineer, was part of the Cyberus team. After his late-night discovery in Dresden, he told Cyberus Chief Technology Officer Werner Haas what he'd found. Before their next in-person meeting, Haas made sure to wear a Stetson, so he could say to Prescher, ""I take my hat off to you.""On Dec. 3, a quiet Sunday afternoon, the Graz researchers ran similar tests, proving Meltdown attacks worked. ""We said, ??Oh God, that can't be possible. We must have a mistake. There shouldn't be this sort of mistake in processors,"" recalled Schwarz.The team told Intel the next day -- around the same time Cyberus informed the chip giant. They heard nothing for more than a week. ""We were amazed -- there was no response,"" Schwarz said.On Dec. 13, Intel let Cyberus and the Graz team know that the problems they found had already been reported by Horn and others. The chipmaker was initially reluctant to let them contribute. But after being pressed, Intel put both groups in touch with the other researchers involved. They all began coordinating a broader response, including releasing updated patches at the same time.Once inside the secret circle of the large tech companies, the Graz researchers expected they would have the typical 90 days to come up with comprehensive fixes before telling the world. ""They said we know it, but will publish it at the beginning of January,"" Schwarz said. It had been roughly 180 days since Google unearthed it, and keeping such issues under wraps for more than 90 days is unusual, he noted.A group of 10 researchers coalesced and kept in touch via Skype every two days. ??It was a lot of work on Christmas. There wasn't a single day where we didn't work. Holidays were canceled,"" Schwarz said.Their public security updates soon attracted the attention of The Register, a U.K.-based technology news site, which wrote a story on Jan. 2 saying Intel products were at risk.?Usually, flaws and their fixes are announced at the same time, so hackers don't quickly abuse the vulnerabilities. This time, the details emerged early and patches weren't ready. That led to a day and a night of frantic activity to arrange what all the companies would say in unison.Intel put the statement out at 12 p.m. Pacific Time on Jan. 3 and held a conference call two hours later to explain what it said was a problem that could impact the whole industry.The solidarity was a mirage, though. Rival AMD issued its own statement shortly before Intel's call began, saying its products were at little or no risk of being exploited. After more than six months of coordinated work, Intel went into lock-down in the final hours and didn't consult with its erstwhile partners to speed up a public statement, according to a person familiar with what happened.Underlining the panic that spread following the announcement, Intel had to follow up with calming statements. The next day, the company said it had made ""significant progress"" in deploying updates, adding that by the end of this week 90 percent of processors made in the last five years will have been secured.Steve Smith and Donald Parker, the two Intel executives questioned on the call, argued things progressed in the measured way that Intel approaches any report of a threat to its technology. The difference this time was that their work ended up ""in the spotlight,?? according to Smith. They would have preferred to complete the work in secret.Indeed, Intel's reticence rankled some outside researchers. The company operates on a need-to-know basis, said Cyberus's Haas, who worked at Intel for about a decade. ""I'm not a huge fan of that.""??Our first priority has been to have a complete mitigation in place,?? said Intel's Parker. ??We've delivered a solution.??Some in the cybersecurity community aren't so sure. Kocher, who helped discover Spectre, thinks this is just the beginning of the industry's woes. Now that new ways to exploit chips have been exposed, there'll be more variations and more flaws that will require more patches and mitigation.""This is just like peeling the lid off the can of worms,"" he said.??

"Bitcoin Futures Deliver Wild Ride as Debut Brings Rally, Halts",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/bitcoin-futures-trading-opens-bringing-crypto-to-wall-street,"December 10, 2017, 6:22 PM EST",technology,"""Cboe trading resumes after two circuit-breakers tripped"", ""Derivatives may ease wagers on cryptocurrency's rise or fall""","Bitcoin has landed on Wall Street.Futures on the world's most popular cryptocurrency surged as much as 26 percent in their debut session on Cboe Global Markets Inc.'s exchange, triggering two temporary trading halts designed to calm the market. Initial volume exceeded dealers' expectations, while traffic on Cboe's website was so heavy that it caused delays and temporary outages. The website's problems had no impact on trading systems, Cboe said. Bitcoin's spot price rose.??It is rare that you see something more volatile than bitcoin, but we found it: bitcoin futures,?? said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia.The launch of futures on a regulated exchange is a watershed for bitcoin, whose surge this year has captivated everyone from mom-and-pop speculators to Wall Street trading firms. The Cboe contracts, soon to be followed by similar offerings from CME Group Inc. and Nasdaq Inc., should make it easier for mainstream investors to bet on the cryptocurrency's rise or fall.Bitcoin wagers have until now been mostly limited to venues with little or no oversight, deterring institutional money managers and exposing some users to the risk of hacks and market breakdowns. About 20 trading firms actively participated, Cboe Chairman Ed Tilly said in a Bloomberg Television interview.QuickTake: You Can Trade Bitcoin Futures. But Should You?Bitcoin futures expiring in January were 18 percent higher at $17,710 as of?12:25 p.m. in New York from an opening level of $15,000, on 3,561 contracts traded.??It was smooth, and bitcoin traders don't seem to be put off by futures,?? said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst in London at online trading firm Oanda. ??There was a fear that short selling would have an adverse impact on price, but we haven't seen that yet.??The spot price climbed 4.7 percent to $16,383 from the Friday 5 p.m. close in New York, according to the composite price on Bloomberg.The roughly $1,300 difference reflects not only the novelty of the asset but also the difficulty of using the cash-settled futures to trade against the spot, strategists said.??In a normal, functioning market, good old arbitrage would settle this,?? Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Hellerup, Denmark, said by email. ??If they were deliverable you could arbitrage the life out of it.??Proponents of regulated bitcoin derivatives say the contracts will increase market transparency and boost liquidity, but skeptics abound. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a ??fraud,?? while China's government has cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges this year. The Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- said this month that contracts in the U.S. were rushed without enough consideration of the risks.So far though, trading has kicked off without any major hiccups.Dealers said volume was high for a new contract, even though it was tiny relative to more established futures. And the trading halts took effect just as Cboe had outlined in its rules. Transactions stopped for two minutes after a 10 percent gain from the opening price, and for five minutes after a 20 percent jump. Another five-minute halt will take effect if the rally extends to 30 percent, Cboe said in a notice on its website.??It was pretty easy to trade,?? Joe Van Hecke, managing partner at Chicago-based Grace Hall Trading LLC, said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, North Carolina. ??I think you'll see a robust market as time plays out.??For now, Cboe futures account for a tiny slice of the world's bitcoin-related bets. The notional value of contracts traded in the first eight hours totaled about $40 million. Globally, about $1.1 billion of bitcoin traded against the U.S. dollar during the same period, according to Cryptocompare.com.Some people who would like to trade futures are having a hard time accessing the market because not all brokers are supporting it initially, said Garrett See, chief executive officer of DV Chain. Participation may also be limited because of higher capital requirements and tighter risk limits, See said.??We're in the early stages here, and there's not enough professional liquidity from the big market makers who can provide depth and hold in the movements,?? said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp. ??It's going to be a learning curve.??It's been painful for investors stuck on the sidelines. This year alone, bitcoin is up more than 17-fold. The surge has been driven largely by demand from individuals, with technical obstacles keeping out most big money managers like mutual funds.The new derivatives contracts should thrust bitcoin more squarely into the realm of regulators, banks and institutional investors. Both Cboe and CME on Dec. 1 got permission to offer the contracts after?pledging to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the products don't run afoul of the law, in a process called self-certification.QuickTake: All about bitcoin, blockchain and the crypto worldNot everyone is happy with the roll out.?Exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing,?the Futures Industry Association said this month. In November, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman of Interactive Brokers Group Inc., wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that bitcoin's large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn't be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives.Still, Interactive Brokers is offering its customers access to the futures, with greater restrictions. The firm's clients won't be able to go short, and Interactive's margin requirement, or?how much investors have to set aside as collateral, will be at least 50 percent.

Go-Jek Acquires Three Companies to Dominate Payment in Indonesia,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/go-jek-acquires-three-companies-to-dominate-payment-in-indonesia,"December 14, 2017, 7:00 PM EST",technology,,"Go-Jek, Indonesia's biggest ride-hailing service, agreed to acquire three local financial-technology companies, underscoring its ambition to become the dominant player in the country's nascent digital-payments industry.The deals bring together Kartuku, Indonesia's largest offline payments-processing company; Midtrans, the nation's top online-payment gateway; and Mapan, a local community-based saving and lending network, Go-Jek said in a statement Friday.Collectively, Go-Jek and the three companies now process almost $5 billion of debit-card, credit-card and digital-wallet transactions for their customers, service providers and merchants. Go-Jek, Indonesia's first $1 billion startup backed by KKR & Co., Warburg Pincus and Tencent Holdings Ltd., didn't disclose the value of the acquisitions.The purchases are the biggest move yet for Go-Jek, which started out by introducing a mobile app in 2015 to let people book cheap motorcycle taxis in traffic-snarled Jakarta. Since then, the company has become a household name in its home country. It's now Indonesia's largest food-delivery business and the leading digital-wallet provider, with 900,000 drivers, more than 125,000 merchants and over 100 million transactions processed through its platform per month.That has allowed the startup to become the leading mobile-based consumer platform in Indonesia, with 15 million weekly active users.Nadiem Makarim??We are now taking Go-Jek to the next stage,"" founder and Chief Executive Officer Nadiem Makarim said in the statement. ??This marks a significant development in our position at the heart of Indonesia's vibrant fintech industry.""He knows that when Go-Jek's payment service -- known as Go-Pay -- works, the results can be powerful. Such a promise has sparked fierce competition with its archrival, Grab, in Indonesia's digital-payments industry. Grab this week announced it is teaming up with Paytren, a popular Indonesian payments app. It acquired local e-commerce platform Kudo earlier this year.Indonesia, home to 260 million people, is expected to add 90 million consumers by 2030, more than any other country outside China and India, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute. Yet 96 percent of the population has no access to credit cards, while 64 percent has had no access to formal banking services for more than 15 years, according to a KPMG report.Go-Jek's customers now use Go-Pay for a wide range of services offered on its mobile app. Makarim told Bloomberg News last week his goal is to let his customers pay for coffee, groceries, tickets and other things outside the realm of Go-Jek's services.The CEOs of each of the three acquired companies will take senior management roles at Go-Jek. Kartuku's Thomas Husted will become Go-Jek's CFO, while Mapan's Aldi Haryopratomo will lead Go-Pay, and Midtrans's Ryu Suliawan will lead Go-Jek's merchant platform."

The companies didn't immediately disclose how much the advisers will be paid.Canonaco's ties to senior Blackstone executives may have helped the three-man shop in London's posh Mayfair neighborhood secure the mandate on one of the largest takeovers of the year. The newcomer's win mirrors the success enjoyed by smaller boutique advisers including Robey Warshaw LLP and Evercore Inc. as well as rainmakers such as Michael Klein in landing key roles -- with juicy fees -- on some large transactions in recent years.??At the end of the day, relationships matter the most in the industry,?? Canonaco said in an interview Wednesday. ??It's based on that, and the trust that we have built over many years that we will be chosen to work on large deals.??Canonaco, the former global head of so-called financial sponsors -- which are mainly private equity and leveraged buyout firms -- as well as sovereign wealth funds and institutional private clients at HSBC, quit in June 2015 after 11 years at the U.K. bank. He'd previously been Lazard's head of financial sponsors in London and European coordinator of financial sponsors coverage.??He's a great banker, and has been a key partner to us in getting the deal teed up and over the finish line,?? said Martin Brand, a senior managing director in Blackstone's private equity group. ??I'm thrilled this is the first deal for him as he's launching his firm.??Simpson spent 18 years at UBS Group AG, where he'd been a managing director for mergers and acquisitions and head of private equity M&A, before joining HSBC, where he was co-head of advisory for Europe during a two-year stint ended in November 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then joined DuCanon Capital Partners, which Canonaco had set up some months earlier, and the firm acted as an adviser on the sale of Clarion Events by Providence Equity Partners to Blackstone in July 2017.Canson Capital, which was founded by the two bankers last year and won its credentials from U.K. authorities in November, will focus on advising private equity, pension and other alternative-asset managers, according to Canonaco.??The idea for us is to replicate the old merchant bank model,?? he said. ??We will co-invest with our partners on deals.??Blackstone's private equity funds, with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and GIC, said late on Tuesday that it agreed to buy the Thomson Reuters unit that provides data, analytics and trading to Wall Street and financial professionals around the world. The consortium will own 55 percent of the business, which is valued at $20 billion, and Thomson Reuters is to get $17 billion in gross proceeds including $3 billion in a cash equity contribution.Thomson Reuters was advised on the transaction by Guggenheim Securities LLC, TD Securities Inc. and Centerview Partners LLC, the company said.Canonaco said he anticipates more private equity deals in the range of $1 billion to $5 billion, with bigger transactions being ??far and few.??Takeovers and IPOs that chose small boutique firms include:Bloomberg LP competes with Thomson Reuters in providing news, data and information to the financial industry.

Line lost 4 billion yen ($37 million) in the quarter, compared with estimates of 2.34 billion in profit, according to Bloomberg data. The company cited upfront costs for AI speakers, game marketing spending and one-time losses related to venture investments and equity method subsidiaries.Since Line's listing in July 2016, Chief Executive Officer Takeshi Idezawa has been under pressure to deliver earnings growth as user base stagnated. Idezawa's plan is to transform the messaging app into an all-in-one communications and entertainment service over the next five years. He has centered it on video and everyday services powered by artificial intelligence.

So it's really paperwork.??The company, which in October reported worse-than-estimated quarterly earnings, has been shedding non-core assets while bolstering its enterprise offerings.

Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick, who has long boasted that he's never sold any shares in the company he co-founded, plans to sell about 29 percent of his stake in the ride-hailing company, people with knowledge of the matter said.Kalanick stands to reap about $1.4 billion from the transaction with SoftBank Group Corp. and a consortium of investors who have agreed to buy equity valuing Uber at $48 billion, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations. Kalanick, who owns 10 percent of the company, had offered to sell as much as half of his stake -- the maximum board members were allowed to tender. He had to pare back the amount because of limits outlined in the agreement between Uber and the buyers, the people said.One of the wealthiest people in the world on paper, Kalanick would become an actual billionaire for the first time as a result of the sale. Kalanick was pressured to resign last year after the company became mired in legal woes and a raft of government investigations into how it does business. He also clashed with Benchmark, one of the company's earliest and biggest investors.Benchmark is selling about $900 million of its Uber stock, or about 14.5 percent of its holdings in the company, a person familiar with the matter said Friday. Recode earlier reported on Benchmark's sale.Terms of the deal bar sellers from parting with more than 58 percent of shares initially offered, requiring Kalanick to sell a smaller portion of his stake. Spokesmen for Uber and Kalanick declined to comment.GV, Alphabet Inc.'s venture capital firm, offered up significantly less than half of its stake in Uber even though Alphabet's self-driving car subsidiary Waymo is suing Uber for stealing trade secrets. In October 2017, another Alphabet investment firm, CapitalG, said that it was leading an investment in Uber's primary U.S. competitor, Lyft Inc.For more on Uber under Kalanick's lead, check out the Decrypted podcast:The SoftBank deal is expect to close later this month.

Spotify Tempts Investors With Report of 70 Million Subscribers,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-04/spotify-tests-whether-investors-believe-in-music-s-resurgence,"January 3, 2018, 9:01 PM EST",technology,"""Streaming provider plans to list shares in first quarter"", ""Music industry sales have grown three years in a row""","Investors are finally getting a crack at the resurgent music business.Spotify, owner of the world's largest paid music service, plans to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange this quarter, passing up a traditional public offering for what's called a direct listing. The debut will test whether investors are ready to buy into the music industry, which was left for dead just a few years ago.Record industry sales have increased for three years in a row thanks to the legions of consumers paying to listen on Spotify and Apple Music. Their spending has far outstripped shrinking album sales in retail outlets and online stores like iTunes, allowing the $15.7 billion global business to prosper again after years of decline. Analysts project revenue could more than double over the next decade.The streaming service&apos;s soaring revenue has been a boon to the music industrySource: Company reportsInvestors have few direct opportunities to tap this potential growth. All three major music companies are part of larger concerns or closely held. Vivendi SA owns Universal Music, while Sony Music is part of the Japanese media and tech conglomerate and billionaire Len Blavatnik owns Warner Music. Music accounts for a small share of business for the industry's biggest retailers, like Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.Spotify?built the most popular on-demand music service in the world, outflanking the largest technology companies, including Apple, and is?trying to prove it can prosper without being a vehicle to sell mobile phones or other products. The company said Thursday subscribers have increased to 70 million, from 60 million in July.??If you look at the leaders in each form of media, music is the last uncaptured sector,?? said Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst at SharesPost Inc. ??Players 30 times bigger than Spotify took stabs at it, but none has won.??Newfound optimism about the future of the music business has boosted the value of catalogs in recent years. Kobalt Capital Ltd. raised $600 million to buy music rights in November and promptly agreed to acquire the collection of Songs Music Publishing for about $150 million. Imagem, which holds rights to 250,000 songs including Daft Punk, Pink Floyd and Stravinsky, was sold to Concord Bicycle Music in a deal Billboard valued at $600 million.Vivendi, the French media company, has weighed a public offering of Universal Music, the world's largest music company, to tap investor enthusiasm.For now though, Spotify is the biggest opportunity. The company was valued at $8.5 billion when it raised money in March 2016, and has since been pegged at more than $15 billion.A direct listing, usually done by much smaller companies, is risky, and Spotify is trying to pull off the biggest one ever. Most would-be stock issuers hire investment bankers to underwrite their shares and go on a roadshow where they raise money by touting their future to potential investors.Spotify isn't trying to raise capital. It's seeking a listing so existing investors can begin selling their shares.?Without the roadshow, the company and its bankers won't have much control over where the shares begin trading or as much insight into the thinking of investors.??There is no example of a successful music-streaming service from a financial standpoint,?? said George Howard, co-founder of TuneCore and Music Audience Exchange, and associate professor at the Berklee College of Music.Spotify believes it is well-known, and investors can also look at limited financial results that have been posted publicly. Yet the company isn't a sure bet. Music industry growth could slow, and the company can't predict how many people worldwide will pay for a service.Pandora Media Inc., an online radio service, went public in June 2011 at $16 a share via a traditional offering. The stock peaked above $40 in March 2014 but now trades below $5, felled by accumulated losses and management turmoil. The shares were little changed at $4.94 in afternoon trading in New York.Spotify lost $601 million in 2016, thanks largely to contracts that require it to pay the majority of its sales to music rights holders. High content costs hampered Pandora before it began losing customers.Spotify has since negotiated new contracts with major music companies that reduce its costs provided it reaches certain performance targets. Those deals have improved its margins, according to Kulkarni, who says the only clear threat to the company is Google's YouTube, which is itself developing a paid subscription service.??Spotify is the only reason for hope in the music business,??

Does he know what he’s doing?""","Early last year, Cheng?Wei, founder and chief executive of the Chinese ride-hailing juggernaut Didi?Chuxing,?tried to resist taking money from legendary investor Masayoshi?Son.?Cheng told the SoftBank?Group chief he didn't need the cash because his?company had already raised $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Fine, Son said, then suggested he might direct his support to one of Didi's rivals.?Cheng relented and took the investment: $5?billion in the largest fundraising round ever for a tech startup.Son pulled a similar maneuver in November, publicly warning?Uber?Technologies that if he didn't get the deal he wanted, his backing would go to archrival Lyft.?Uber?also took the money in a $9 billion investment unveiled last?week.Masayoshi Son has been an unstoppable force in?the technology world over?the last?year. As he lined?up?a roster of big backers??Saudi Arabia's crown prince and Apple's Tim Cook among them??for?SoftBank's planned $100 billion Vision Fund,?Son took stakes in scores of businesses engaged in a dizzying array of activities:?ride-hailing, chip-making, office-sharing, satellite-building, robot-making, even indoor kale-farming.?Son's?idiosyncratic?deal-making?has confounded?admirers and detractors for years. And the latest frenzy has been no exception.?In deal after deal,?according to people involved, Son pressed to meet founders face to face, encouraged?them to take more money than they wanted and?wielded his outsized checkbook?as a weapon. Along the way, he?rattled rivals with his growing influence and changed the game of startup investing -- for better or worse.??There really isn't?a precedent for this,???says Steven?Kaplan, a professor at University of Chicago's Booth School of Business who co-founded its entrepreneurship program. ??The jury is still out on whether it will work.??Son's investment strategy defies?easy categorization.?He portrays himself as a true believer in the information revolution, a proponent of the so-called singularity??the notion that one day computers will mesh?with human brains and bodies. But Son has skeptics?aplenty. They wonder how ride-hailing fits with money management. Or what satellites have to do with indoor farming.Son, 60, has made hundreds of investments since he founded SoftBank?in 1981 and during the dot-com bubble was briefly the world's richest man. But the vast majority of those deals failed, and Son's reputation rests almost solely on one transaction: an investment in Alibaba?Group Holding that started with?$20 million in 2000.SoftBank's stake is now worth about 15.5 trillion yen?($138?billion), one of the most lucrative venture investments of all time. But many people think that was a fluke. Son got lucky one time. Can he do it again?Son declined to comment for this story. A SoftBank?spokesman said his track record of success goes well beyond Alibaba and includes investments in Sprint, Yahoo! and Supercell, the developer of games like Clash Royale.The latest deal-making spree began in September of 2016. Mohammed bin Salman, deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia at the time, flew to Tokyo as his country was looking for ways to diversify beyond oil. He met with Son, who pitched the idea of setting up the largest investment fund in history to finance technology startups. In less than an hour, bin Salman agreed to become the cornerstone investor. ??Forty-five minutes, $45 billion,???Son said on The David Rubenstein Show in September. ??One billion dollars per minute.??Son didn&apos;t wait for the money to come in before starting to cut?deals. He?made about 100 investments last year with a total value of $36?billion, according to research firm Preqin. That&apos;s more in dollar terms than Silicon Valley's top two heavyweights, Sequoia Capital and Silver Lake, combined.More surprising given the numbers is that SoftBank is largely a one-man show when it comes to deals, despite its ranks of bankers from Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Lieutenants pitch Son ideas, but he makes the final decisions ?C?and he generates plenty of his own. Tellingly, he is the only so-called key man in the Vision Fund, while most investment funds have several people with the influential designation. (Limited partners have the option to withdraw from a fund if any ??key men?? leave.)???It&apos;s 100 percent Masa,?? says one CEO who agreed to sell Son a stake in his company. ??Okay, 99.9 percent Masa.??Son typically brings in his bankers when there's a complex deal structure, like in the?Uber?deal. In that case, SoftBank bought most of its shares through a tender offer with tricky legal aspects because of a nasty board dispute and the many investors involved.?The SoftBank spokesman said decisions are ??made by the organization after due diligence and process.??Son has an unusually personal approach. He often invites founders to Tokyo to talk face to face, conversing in English. He&apos;ll typically begin with a formal meeting in one of his conference rooms on SoftBank&apos;s 26th floor. Then Son, his guest and staff will move to?the private dining area on the same floor, according to people who have attended the meetings. Visitors can wander in his garden or relax on traditional?tatami mats. Son&apos;s personal chef prepares Japanese specialties. Big-screen TVs often play SoftBank Hawks baseball games. There's little small talk though.??He asks a lot of questions,???says Greg Wyler, the CEO of satellite provider OneWeb, which received a $1 billion SoftBank investment in December 2016. ??If you like thinking really hard and really fast and you like thinking through the art of the possible, it&apos;s a wonderfully motivating experience.??Son&apos;s staff does due diligence before he meets with startup founders. So he has a good sense of whether he wants to invest before the meeting starts. His questions are usually focused on prodding founders to think more broadly about opportunities.Eugene Izhikevich was invited to Tokyo in May. A prominent Russian neuroscientist who lives in San Diego, he runs a startup that builds brains for robots. Izhikevich pitched Son on investing ??tens of millions?? so his company could develop robots that would find widespread use in a decade or two. ??He interrupted me in the middle of my presentation and said, ??I got it,'???Izhikevich?says. ??How much do you need to achieve your vision???The Russian realized Son wanted to give him more money than he was requesting??on the condition that?Izhikevich?accelerate his work.?Son didn&apos;t want to wait 10 or 20 years. He wanted a full range of robots in three to five years. ??Robots everywhere, that&apos;s the vision we share,?? Izhikevich says. ??What drives me crazy is how slow things are. In Masa, I found my match.??In July, SoftBank announced a $114 million investment in Izhikevich&apos;s Brain Corp. The Russian appreciates the money, but admits he now feels the pressure of living up to Son&apos;s expectations.?Son is largely hands-off after cutting a check, though he stays in touch with founders by phone and?email. He sits on the boards of a handful of companies, including?Sprint, Alibaba and ARM Holdings, the chipmaker he acquired in 2016 for $32 billion in the biggest deal of his career. He did get deeply involved in?the operations of Sprint as that company struggled.While some question the wisdom of?giving entrepreneurs more cash than they&apos;re looking for, there&apos;s another way to look at Son&apos;s 2017 Blitzkrieg. He&apos;s gotten SoftBank big stakes in more than a dozen of the most prominent startups in the world, including the two most valuable (Uber?and Didi). In the process, he&apos;s shown he can help entrepreneurs chase ambitious, expensive dreams with a single check. ??For all of the founders I work with, he is now the first name on their list,???says Mark Tluszcz, who co-founded the?venture firm Mangrove Capital Partners.Son has faced skeptics his entire life. He grew up on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, bullied as a child because of his Korean ancestry. His father more than made up for the abuse, doting on his son and praising him as a genius for his business acumen. Son left Japan at 16 to study in the U.S. and launched his career as an entrepreneur while at the University of California at Berkeley. He brought Space Invaders game machines from Japan to the U.S. and invented an electronic translator that he sold for about $1 million.Son likes to talk about how?he proved doubters wrong after?returning?to Japan to build his empire. He made early investments in Yahoo! and Yahoo Japan, as well as Alibaba. He took over Vodafone&apos;s Japanese wireless operation when everyone thought the business was hopeless and, by persuading Steve Jobs to give him exclusive rights to the first iPhone?in Japan, turned it into a fierce competitor.He stumbled plenty,?too. During the dot-com boom, Son was one of the most enthusiastic investors??backing more than 800 startups to create what he called a ??netbatsu,?? the digital-age equivalent of Japan's zaibatsu conglomerates.?But with the crash, almost all those companies failed. Son had the distinction of losing more money than anyone else ever had??$70?billion.Son doesn&apos;t use the same term these days, but what he&apos;s assembling resembles his old netbatsu. He describes the people at the startups he's backing? as ??comrades?? and?how they&apos;re part of the broader SoftBank Group. He talks about opportunities for SoftBank-backed companies to collaborate ?C?even when all they have in common is his money.Chris Lane, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein,?says about eight in 10 of the investors he talks with are skeptical of Son. They see him as a solid telecom operator who is taking enormous risks with his investments and has demonstrated no special skill in technology investment. Lane sees clear evidence of that disbelief: SoftBank's stock in Alibaba and other assets are worth more than 19 trillion yen after subtracting all its debt, but SoftBank's market cap is?only 9.8 trillion yen. It's?like your neighbor having a suitcase stuffed with $1 million in cash, but you&apos;ll only pay him $500,000 for it because you think he&apos;ll lose the rest on the way to your house. Critics not only don&apos;t believe Son can pick the next Alibaba; they&apos;re convinced he&apos;s going to squander what he already has.??If you think of this as a telco making unrelated investments and likely to lose money, then maybe the discount is right,???Lane says. ??If you think this is a sophisticated technology investment firm with a strong track record, then this is an unbelievable opportunity.??Lane initiated coverage of SoftBank?in October with a buy rating because he's a believer ?C?he sees Son as the Warren Buffett of the tech industry. But since then, the discount from Son's assets to his market value has widened from 41 percent to almost 50 percent.Son has talked about the discount regularly on investor calls, sounding frustrated at times and elated at others. In May, he compared SoftBank to the goose that lays golden eggs, arguing?his company doesn't get credit for its?eggs much less the goose itself. ??The goose has more value than the golden eggs. I don't know how you don't think this,'' he said, then later added, ??if you ask me, it&apos;s better to be undervalued?because it leaves room for growth.??Perhaps no Son investment is more important to?his reputation than?the one in Uber. The SoftBank chief is betting heavily on Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi, who has pledged to repair a toxic culture, overcome regulatory pushback and take on mounting competition before leading?Uber to a successful IPO.???This is a critical test for SoftBank and whether they can deploy large amounts of money in late-stage investments,???Lane says. ??The market will judge [Son] by the Uber IPO.??Son holds a potentially commanding position. SoftBank?has?stakes in the biggest ride-hailing startups in the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Southeast Asia. Four of the SoftBank-backed startups compete with each other, including in key markets like India and Indonesia. So Son may encourage the rivals to make peace, merging operations in certain countries to save billions in subsidies for drivers and customers. For example, Grab,?the largest ride-hailing service in Southeast Asia, may acquire much of Uber&apos;s operation in the region, according to a person familiar with the matter. Didi?could also move to acquire Grab to accelerate its expansion beyond China.But there&apos;s a limit to what Son can do. He doesn&apos;t hold controlling stakes in any of the companies, including Uber and Grab. So he can&apos;t force them into deals if management or other investors resist, but he may help them see their own economic interests. ??SoftBank will do its best to eliminate unhealthy competition,???says Bernstein&apos;s Lane.Longer term, Son will have to do a better job?articulating?how his deals fit together.?At the company&apos;s annual shareholders meeting in June, he closed with an awkward video the company has used for years to explain its view of technology's future.?It opens with a blond man wandering among stone ruins. ??Sorrow is inherent to the human condition,?? he says, staring into the camera. ??Since the beginning of time, humans have sought to overcome sorrow.??The clip goes on to explain how technology will connect people on opposites sides of the world and allow them to share thoughts and ideas. It closes with the man wading through a field of waist-high grass. ??Together we&apos;ll open the doors to a new century of happiness and joy,?? he says. Bafflement ensued.Even as his allies describe it, Son&apos;s vision seems like garden-variety optimism about a technological future that has been enunciated by many industry leaders: a trillion connected devices, generating data that will be analyzed by?artificial intelligence to supposedly make the world a better place.At a SoftBank?conference in July, Son took the time to answer critics who say Alibaba is his sole success. He flashed a slide citing his other successful deals and another showing?his investments have returned 44 percent annually including Alibaba??and 42 percent without it.??You may think, ??you were lucky because you hit upon Alibaba,'?? he said. ??That's true. I&apos;m really, really grateful to Jack Ma. It was not just one lucky hit. Perhaps if you continue with lucky hits then it&apos;s your capability. Maybe I&apos;m smart after all!''Or maybe just too powerful to ignore.?Anthony Tan, who co-founded the Grab taxi-hailing service, recalls first meeting Son a few years ago when the Japanese billionaire was considering?investing in his startup. As the two chatted, Son?mentioned?his early support for Ma, then an unknown school teacher who is now the richest man in China. ??Years ago, Jack Ma sat there,???Tan recalls Son telling him. ??Anthony-san, you take my money. It&apos;s good for you. It&apos;s good for me. If you don&apos;t take my money, not so good for you.??Like so many others before and since,?Tan took Son's money.?? With assistance by Yoolim Lee"

But buried at the bottom of its landing page was a small box -- checked by default -- that automatically enrolled users to its Sesame Credit unless they opted out.?The subsequent online uproar prompted Ant to change that setting and to call the move ??extremely idiotic,?? according to a post on its official social media account.The online outrage highlights growing concerns over a lack of transparency on how companies are gathering and using personal data, even in a country where people are subject to persistent government monitoring and censorship. Tencent Holdings Ltd. this week publicly denied it was?storing users' chat histories after a high-profile entrepreneur questioned whether it was keeping tabs on private conversations.It also underscores how personal data has become the new currency in an ongoing race between China's tech giants, already pioneers in the field of using highly granular mobile and online information to determine an individual's credit-worthiness. Ant, formally known as Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group, said that none of the users who involuntarily opted in for Sesame Credit would be enrolled in the program.

Facebook, along with its other properties including Instagram, won't allow ads that say ""Use your retirement funds to buy Bitcoin!"" for example, or those that promote binary options trading, a risky derivative with an all-or-nothing payoff.??We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception,??

Regulators have recently started to crack down. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said this week that it got a court order freezing the assets of an alleged initial coin offering scam by AriseBank. Still, enthusiasm for bitcoin and other volatile digital currencies has minted many millionaires. Public companies have capitalized on the hype, with everything from packaged-food makers to sports-bra manufacturers seeing shares surge after linking their firms to crypto, sometimes just by name.Earlier this month, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg referred to cryptocurrencies and other technologies that decentralize power as a trend he was studying in 2018, part of an effort to correct problems on the social network. While some enthusiasts took this as a positive sign for digital currencies, Zuckerberg wrote at the time that he was looking at both the positive and negative aspects of the technology.Bitcoin has a history of big run-ups in price followed by steep declines.

Fees reached about $20 per transaction last week, compared with about 20 cents when bitcoin was first enabled, the company said in the statement.Steam's decision is a setback for the cryptocurrency's adoption and shows how the original vision of bitcoin as a widely used decentralized payment system may be some way off. While the largest digital currency gained more traction within the financial community this year as it soared more than 1,300 percent to above $14,000, many have claimed that it is a bubble waiting to burst.Bitcoin's surging popularity?and limits on the amount of data processed on the network has caused transaction times and fees to jump, making it harder to match traditional cash as an established a medium of buying and selling goods.The issue with bitcoin payment is hard to resolve as customers must pay the fee again when they receive refunds for their original payment or transfer additional funds to match the new fee, Steam said. The company said in August it has 67 million monthly active players, GeekWire reported earlier. Steam first started accepting bitcoin last April, according to CoinDesk.Bitcoin surged to a record high on Thursday amid optimism the introduction of futures is boosting the legitimacy of the world's most valuable digital currency. But for some, the promise of cryptocurrency as electronic cash simply doesn't rest on bitcoin: the Steam announcements comments section was filled with suggestions of other tokens, including litecoin, bitcoin cash and dash.Bitcoin's answer to easing congestion is the Lightning Network.

Twitter's shares slipped the most in almost two months.Noto will assume the post at SoFi in March. His departure comes at a pivotal time for Twitter, which is finally showing results from its turnaround efforts. Since beating Wall Street's estimates in late October, the company has been upgraded by at least six analysts, who have cited more user engagement and improvements in Twitter's live video advertising.Noto's take-action attitude has been an important balancing presence to CEO Jack Dorsey's introverted leadership style, according to people familiar with the matter. Losing him may deal a blow to the company's positive momentum.Twitter hired Noto, 49, as CFO in 2014 with a stock award worth more than $60 million, following a career in banking at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he helped Twitter go public. He served as the social-media company's finance head before taking over as chief operating officer in 2016. Noto has played a leading role in directing the company's product vision, especially in shaping the platform's future around live video streaming.""He has been reassuring force for investors even amidst the stock's volatile performance over the past several years,"" Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note.

San Francisco-based SoFi, one of the most valuable fin-tech startups, lost its co-founder and CEO, Mike Cagney, last fall amid company turmoil, including allegations of sexual harassment and fraudulent actions by managers. Other high-ranking executives have also departed, leaving it without a permanent chief financial officer and chief revenue officer.Cagney had envisioned building SoFi into a bank of the future, targeting millennial consumers with products ranging from insurance and mortgages to wealth management. With Cagney gone, those plans have been slowed or put on hold.SoFi Executive Chairman Tom Hutton has served as interim CEO since Cagney stepped down.

The most immediate use, though, might be for commodity traders tracking the supply of cattle.Microbes in a cow's stomach produce methane as they break down food, which is then released in manure, burps and flatulence. Measuring levels of the gas can indicate the size of herds in areas where shelters block visual checks, such as dairy farms or feedlots, said Yotam Ariel, Bluefield's founder and chief executive officer. Such data can offer near real-time insight into fundamentals affecting cattle prices, as well as feed crops such as corn and soy, Ariel said.??You can see the full life-cycle of a cow,?? Ariel said in a phone interview. ??For example, you can index the whole beef landscape in China as it changes daily, and see the cycle long before government reports.??Cattle futures are the most heavily traded livestock derivative on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with open interest of about 350,000 contracts, and government reports on herd size can swing prices.

Companies and governments launched 310 satellites during the first eight months of last year, compared to 169 for all of 2016, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.Measuring methane from space is at least a few years away from becoming a reality.

The Top EV in the U.S. Not Sold by Elon Musk? The Chevy Bolt,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-03/gm-s-bolt-doubles-nissan-leaf-sales-as-chevy-ev-chases-tesla,"January 3, 2018, 2:06 PM EST",climate-changed,,"And the prize for America's best-selling electric car not made by Elon Musk goes to ... the Chevrolet Bolt.General Motors Co.'s plug-in Bolt outsold Nissan Motor Co.'s electric Leaf more than two-to-one in the U.S. last year, data reported by the automakers Wednesday showed. The Bolt capped its first full year of sales with its strongest month, delivering more than 3,200 units in December as employee pricing offers to the public got attention for a car that's only been available nationally since August.The Bolt also outsold plug-in hybrid models including Toyota Motor Corp.'s Prius Prime and Chevy's own Volt. It was probably surpassed only by Tesla Inc., whose Model S was the top-selling electric vehicle globally in 2016. Tesla projected sales of about 100,000 Model S sedans and Model X crossovers worldwide for last year, though the company doesn't break out how many of those deliveries were to U.S. buyers.The Bolt gaining momentum may be a sign that drivers who like plug-in cars increasingly want pure EVs, not hybrids that use a combination of gasoline power and electric drive. The Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid's sales shorted out last year, falling 18 percent from 2016 levels. Still, even with growing interest in the Bolt and Tesla's expanding lineup, pure electric cars make up just 0.6 percent of the U.S. vehicle market, according to researcher Cox Automotive Inc.There were a couple other mitigating factors in GM's victory over Nissan in the plug-in segment. Nissan is in the process of clearing out the old Leaf and making way for a completely redesigned model, which will be available at U.S. dealerships later this month.GM&apos;s all-electric sedan outsells other plug-in models in 2017Source: Company statementsNote: Chart shows top-selling battery-powered models including plug-in hybrids; excludes results for Tesla, which doesn&apos;t break out U.S. deliveries??We have a lot of orders in the pipeline.

Judy Wheeler, Nissan's vice president for U.S. sales, said in a phone interview. ??After that will be a better time for getting a perspective on possibilities for the new Leaf.??Both the Bolt and the Leaf will be challenged by Tesla's Model 3, which hits a similar price point at $35,000.

Health makes up 22 percent of the gauge, and price increases in the sector had already been sluggish over the past decade or so.The thinking is that the effort being spearheaded by Bezos's Amazon.com Inc., Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Dimon's JPMorgan Chase & Co. is almost certainly aimed at disrupting the broader industry, even if details were scant in their statement Tuesday. The effect won't be seen right away, of course -- it takes a long time to build a new health-care system from the ground up -- but over the long term, the impact could be significant.The health plan ??could have a meaningful impact on core PCE?? and the broader consumer price index,?said Ben Emons, the chief economist and head of credit portfolio management at Intellectus Partners.Janet Yellen, whose last meeting as the Fed's chair is this week, has blamed transitory factors such as low wage growth and falling costs for cell-phone service for her inability to boost PCE to the 2 percent level that it hasn't seen since mid-2012. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge rebounded to an annual rate of more than 1.5 percent at the end of 2017 after slowing below 1.3 percent in August.There's been little reaction in market-based measures of inflation Tuesday, in stark contrast to the rout in health-care stocks battered by Amazon's entry into the space. But that's not too surprising, according to Emons, as those are based on the consumer price index, a metric which places a much lower weighting on health care than PCE.To be sure, if any new health-care drag on inflation comes after prices have risen to the Fed's goal, it could be good news for policy makers by helping to keep prices in check.For now, the health-care effort is unlikely to effect near-term Fed strategy, according to Stephen Gallagher, the chief U.S. economist at Societe Generale in New York. Over the long-term, however, there's the potential to meaningfully reduce costs, he said.??You're bringing technology into an area that has been somewhat resistant to some of the forces of price discovery and supply-demand,?? Gallagher said. ??More price discovery, more information -- it would tend to bring prices down. The question is how soon would this happen.??"

World's Best Breezes Lead to Cheapest Wind Power in Brazil,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/world-s-best-breezes-lead-to-cheapest-wind-power-in-brazil,"January 10, 2018, 3:00 AM EST",climate-changed,"""Voltalia developing power plants in windiest part of country"", ""Strong wind let French company bid record low price in auction""","In northeast Brazil, beyond the resorts and pristine beaches, lie some of the world's best winds for generating electricity.Welcome to?Serra Branca. It's a wind generator's heaven, featuring breezes so perfect for spinning turbines that this Brazilian region is capable of churning out more wind energy than any other part of the world. In the latest testament to the region's wind bounty, a French renewable energy company, Voltalia SA, just won contracts to build more farms there that'll sell the cheapest wind power Brazil has ever seen.Voltalia's Vamcruz wind complex operating in Serra Branca cluster, in Rio Grande do Norte.??Our strategy is to gain scale in that area,???Robert Klein, country manager at Voltalia Brazil said in an interview. ??High volume is key to being competitive.??Voltalia's buildout underscores just how big Brazil's wind power market stands to get. The country already has almost 11 gigawatts of turbines in operation now and was ranked the No. 5 wind market in the world based on 2016 installations, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.Consistent breezes give the country a capacity factor of 39 percent, the amount of electricity produced compared to its potential output if every turbine was spinning all the time.That's the best in the world. And Rio Grande do Norte state -- where Serra Branca is located -- with higher average speeds and little variation in wind direction, is even better.?That's why the state accounts for the most wind-power capacity in Brazil, with 2.7 gigawatts, followed by Bahia, with 1.6 gigawatts.Two of Voltalia's existing wind farms there were rated among the five most efficient in Brazil in 2016, coming in at 60.8 percent and 58.4 percent, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Brazil ??clearly has a strong wind resource, some of the best wind sites in the world, so it's potentially a very strong market,?? said?Gurpreet Gujral, an analyst at Macquarie Bank Ltd. The country is seeking to increase installed clean-energy capacity by 19 gigawatts by 2026 to diversify the local grid.More wind translates into more electricity to sell, allowing Voltalia to offer lower prices. The company won contracts to supply energy from five projects with 155 megawatts of capacity in a pair of government-organized auctions last month. In one of the events, it offered to deliver electricity for 96.90 reais ($29.82) a megawatt-hour, a record low.The company expects to invest 867 million reais for the projects, according to Brazil's Electric Energy Trading Board, known as CCEE. They must be connected to the grid in December 2020 for contracts from the first auction. For the second, they must be connected by December 2022.The company is developing a total of 1,000 megawatts of wind farms in the region, and may bid for contracts in the next auction, set for April. Partnering with suppliers such as turbine makers also helps Voltalia keep costs down, Klein said.??Our appetite continues to be high,?? he said.??Voltalia's bids were surprising,?? said Helena Chung, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. ??But the company is a top performer in Brazil, with projects operating at good efficiency rates. And wind turbine prices are falling, given the high competition in the last auctions.??Voltalia's aggressive bids were followed by other developers including Enel Green Power SpA, with a bid of 97 reais a megawatt-hour, reflecting pent-up demand after two years without wind-power auctions. The government canceled two auctions in 2016 as an economic recession curbed electricity demand.Now, with the economy starting to recover and electricity consumption rising, interest in new power plants is growing.??The fact that Brazil is resuming doing auctions is very important,?? Klein said. ??The wind industry was halted and now it's reborn in a brilliant way.???? With assistance by Anna Hirtenstein"

A city is allowed 18 breaches in a year, which a site in Brixton in south London reached on Tuesday, according to King's College London Air monitoring organization. It's expected to pass the yearly limit in the next day or two.??The mayor has taken some bold and welcome steps to deal with London's toxic air problem since coming to office, and the later breach this year shows his policies are making a difference, ?? said Simon Alcock, a spokesman for ClientEarth, a law firm that has taken the U.K. government to court three times on pollution. ??It's still only a month into 2018, and London has breached limits for the whole year, which shows there's much more to do.??The U.K. has been breaking the European Union's rules on clean air since 2010. While the nation is in the process of leaving the trade bloc, its laws still apply until the divorce is official. Prime Minister Theresa May has said that she intends to ensure that Brexit will not mean a lowering of environmental standards.There have been some recent initiatives by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, an asthmatic, to try to clean up the capital's air. He has enacted charges for people driving the dirtiest vehicles and put cleaner buses on routes with especially polluted roads. He is also planning to create low-emission zones by April 2019.??At long last we are seeing some improvements in our toxic air, but much more needs to be done before Londoners can finally breathe a proper sigh of relief,?? Khan said in a statement.London's air pollution is largely nitrogen oxide which is from vehicle exhaust. Burning diesel emits significantly more pollutants than gasoline and can have an adverse effect on human health, a raft of studies have shown. The U.K.'s top court has ruled that the U.K. government has broken the law by failing to adequately deal with toxic smog.??Tougher action is needed to protect more Londoners, sooner,?? said Oliver Hayes, a campaigner for clean air at Friends of the Earth. ??A decent scrappage scheme to compensate diesel drivers must go hand in hand with a network of genuinely effective Clean Air Zones across the country.??"

It has movement sensors and software algorithms that can determine how long a person slept, if the sleep was interrupted, and whether the person snored. Nokia's software will give people an overall ""sleep score,"" and will also work with smart home appliances so that, for example, lights can automatically turn on or off if the system senses that the person has fallen asleep or woken up.Rob Le Bras-Brown, Nokia's executive in charge of health products, said in an interview that the system isn't as accurate as clinical-grade sleep studies. But he believes it's more useful than its competitors.Nokia is launching the $99 device?at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas this week. That's months after Apple Inc. acquired a Finnish startup called Beddit, which sold a similar product. Apple still sells the Beddit sleep tracker on its website but hasn't branded it as an Apple product and hasn't integrated the technology into its own product line. Withings, a health device company acquired by Nokia in 2016, sold its own sleep tracker called the Aura for nearly $300."

In 2008, they co-founded Asana?Inc., a San Francisco startup devoted to making project?management software?that lets employees focus on the task at hand while fighting pesky nuisances like email and app notifications.For years before that though,?they helped to magnify the very digital interruptions their users are now trying to resist.?Moskovitz?was Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard University and is Facebook Inc.'s co-founder. Rosenstein, after a stint at Google working on tools like Google Chat,?helped to create Facebook's ??like?? button.The partners aren't as disdainful about their past creations as some of their former colleagues. Sean Parker, Facebook's first president, has lamented social media's addictive nature, while former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya, now a venture capitalist, argues that it's?ripping society apart. The Asana founders think their software, which helps an organization manage and prioritize tasks, can help cure?the scourge of workplace distraction.??The average knowledge worker works out of their email inbox, just continuously scanning it for what they should do next,???said Moskovitz. ??Just being able to come in every day and focus on my task list, in priority order, helps a ton with being able to focus on what's important.??Now a new group of investors is also betting that Asana can be part of the solution. The startup plans to announce Tuesday it has raised $75 million in venture funding, in a round led by Al Gore's Generation Investment Management. Other investors include 8VC, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Y Combinator?President Sam Altman?and Moskovitz himself.Asana's goal is to eliminate ??the work about work,?? or???the meetings, emails and status updates,?and all of this coordination cost just to keep everyone on the same page,???said Rosenstein, the company's head of product.?In Asana's software, users can assign each other projects and track the progress of each task. Teams at Airbnb?Inc., Uber?Technologies Inc. and Pinterest?Inc. use it,?but the company likes to highlight customers like the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, a century-old German heating and air conditioning company called Viessmann Group?and the city government of Providence, Rhode Island.?Asana is part of a wave of startups making new kinds of online collaboration tools, like the office chat company Slack?Technologies Inc. While the younger Slack has 50,000 teams paying for its service, Asana?has grown more slowly: It boasts about 30,000. Both services?offer?free and paid versions with additional features. (Asana's is $10 per user per month.)?Both also launched more sophisticated versions for large companies?about a year ago.In the latest round, investors valued Asana at around $900 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trello, a task-management tool with some similar features, sold to the Australian software company Atlassian?Corp.?a year ago for $425 million. More than 45 percent of paying Asana?users are outside the U.S.,?and it's adding languages like French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese, the company said.The new funding will help Asana expand its overseas sales and customer operations, and continue to develop on its product for large companies. Asana is also working on tailoring its software for specific uses, such as magazine planning or starting a company, said Chris Farinacci, its head of business. To Moskovitz and his colleagues, who can embody the tech industry earnestness that's so easily mocked on shows like HBO's Silicon Valley,?Asana is also about bringing mindfulness to the world. ??If we can build a single tool to enable any team to work together more efficiently, that can accelerate human progress,?? said Rosenstein, who meditates an hour per day. Of course, Asana could also make organizations with bad intentions more efficient, but???I just have to take comfort for now that there are fewer of them,???Rosenstein said.As for whether their former employer could be one of those malevolent organizations, the founders are more subdued. Asked about the recent controversies swirling around Facebook, Moskovitz mentions how demonstrators used the social network to organize events like the Women's March and said???I'm pretty confident things are net positive. I'm a little sad that the good parts have been sort of swept aside and diminished.?? He adds that ??it's an opportunity to do a better job evolving the relationship that Facebook has with its users, and there's a big need for users to mature their relationship to technology. If it's not Facebook,?it's going to?be something else.??Rosenstein said the original purpose of the like button was to spread positivity and help focus attention on valuable content. Instead of seeing technology as all good or all terrible, he said, ??the middle way is mindfulness??to accept that every time you take a step forward, there's going to be a half step back.??Meanwhile, their plan to keep technology's influence under control involves more technology. Moskovitz?imagines adding artificial intelligence to future versions of Asana, so that the software only sends the most urgent notifications. To Rosenstein, Asana could one day serve as an all-seeing project manager, which assigns tasks based on knowing an employee's?individual strengths, what tasks are most important, even the time of day. ??That coordination work??it's soul-sucking and emotionally damaging. And if we can leave all that work to Asana's robots, then we can let humans focus on the things that are intrinsically human.??"

The round was led by existing investor Dawn and the Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund.The new funding round follows just three months after iZettle announced it was getting 30 million euros ($36 million) in debt funding from the European Investment Bank to create new products. In January, iZettle received 60 million euros, including 45 million in debt financing from Chicago-based Victory Park Capital, where it was valued around $500 million.A spokeswoman for iZettle declined to comment on the company's valuation.iZettle began by selling white, rectangular credit card-readers that plug into iPhones or iPads, allowing small business owners such as food truck vendors and small retailer to quickly process transactions. Competing with the likes of Square Inc., in the U.K., it has since expanded to small business lending service and a wider range of payments software.While iZettle's Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jacob de Geer has previously flagged the company will target an IPO, payments companies have become increasingly attractive to private equity. Blackstone Group LP and CVC Capital Partners agreed to buy Paysafe Group Plc, which provides technology that enables digital wallets as well as online and mobile payments, for about 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in August. One month later, U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC agreed to buy Nets A/S for about 33 billion kroner ($5.3 billion)."

Those bitcoin holdings are now worth several hundred million dollars, though Founders Fund has yet to return any gains to its investors, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investment hasn't been publicly disclosed. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the firm's bitcoin purchases.While the investment amounts to a rounding error for Thiel's firm, which has more than $3 billion under management, it represents a departure from the way most venture investors have approached the bitcoin space.Venture capital firms plowed more than $1.38 billion into blockchain startups -- companies working on the technology underlying bitcoin -- during 2016 and 2017, according to research firm CB Insights. Uses of the blockchain, a decentralized ledger system, range from enterprise software and e-commerce to the more buzzy bitcoin currency exchanges, trading platforms and mining companies.In bankrolling the infrastructure to support the digital currency, investors including Draper Associates and Andreessen Horowitz have taken a measured approach, backing blockchain technology rather than buying bitcoin itself.The performance gap between bitcoin-related startups and bitcoin as a currency has been a sore point during partner meetings at some venture firms. Startup shares are illiquid and take an average of seven to 10 years to deliver a return, and 90 percent of such companies fail. Some VC partners argue that a direct investment in the currency would have been smarter than backing the startups, even though it's not a traditional venture deal, pointing to the surge in bitcoin value -- it jumped about 1,400 percent in 2017 -- and the fact that it can be traded immediately.But with bitcoin prices hovering around $14,700, it's doubtful whether any venture investors still see a bargain.Back in November, Thiel thought bitcoin's price was very high, said the person familiar with Founders Fund. The investor felt comfortable buying it at about $2,000 to $3,000, the person said.A Founders Fund spokeswoman confirmed that the firm invested in bitcoin infrastructure companies BitPay, BitGo, Polychain and MetaStable, but declined to comment on the firm's ownership of bitcoin."

The service will be available to most customers of Square cash, which lets users transfer money to friends and family. Those located in New York, Georgia, Wyoming or Hawaii are excluded.The company said most of the purchases and sales happen within seconds, and it won't add an additional percentage or fixed dollar amount onto the sale of Bitcoin. Users can buy as much as $10,000 worth of Bitcoin per week, though there's no limit to the number of Bitcoins users can sell. One Bitcoin currently trades for about $10,000.The market for Bitcoin trading platforms is becoming increasingly crowded. Last week, stock-trading app Robinhood said it would roll out free Bitcoin and etherum trading in five states. More than a million people have signed up for ""early access"" in the few days after the announcement. Square's service will also compete with Coinbase, the largest U.S. marketplace for trading cryptocurrencies.Integrating Bitcoin trading into Square's cash app isn't without risk. The largest exchanges have suffered from slow trading as demand for crypto has skyrocketed. Coinbase has experienced performance issues, including outages, slow load times and a flash crash in ether, the second most valuable virtual coin.Square's move came as some companies have begun to distance themselves from the risky digital-currency market. On Jan. 23, payments startup Stripe Inc. said it would be ending support for Bitcoin payments due to long transaction times and high fees.

New Nafta Pits Silicon Valley Against Hollywood Over Copyright,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/new-nafta-pits-silicon-valley-against-hollywood-over-copyright,"December 14, 2017, 4:00 AM EST",politics,"""U.S. proposal waters down safeguards for online firms: sources"", ""Film and music industries say creators deserve to be rewarded""","Online giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. are facing off against Hollywood studios and record labels over how to update the North American Free Trade Agreement to protect copyright in the digital age.Silicon Valley is pushing for exceptions to copyright rules for online platforms and Internet service providers it says are needed to keep content flowing on the web. Meanwhile, the U.S. government seems to be taking positions favored by companies such as Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Inc., which are lobbying for stronger protections for copyright owners.So far, neither side is declaring victory. Industry insiders say haggling over copyright could go down to the wire. While Nafta negotiators meeting this week in Washington are scheduled to discuss digital trade issues, intellectual property isn't on the agenda, according to a copy seen by Bloomberg News. Negotiators are punting decisions on harder issues into 2018.The U.S. wants to?limit allowances for online use of copyrighted material in Nafta, according to two people familiar with the U.S. proposal. That could upset companies like Google and Facebook, which would see that as less supportive of online platforms than existing U.S. law.Those so-called fair-use exceptions are seen to shield Google when it posts book excerpts in search results, for example. The U.S. Nafta proposal doesn't spell out as many exceptions as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which included the U.S., Canada and Mexico, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks aren't public. But an entertainment-industry representative said TPP shouldn't be the benchmark, since it made exceptions for online companies that weren't included in previous U.S. trade deals.The U.S. proposal also doesn't offer ISPs the same level of protection they've received in past trade deals for unintentionally carrying pirated work over their networks, said two of the people. So-called safe-harbor clauses in U.S. law shelter ISPs from liability as long as they make ??good faith?? efforts to take down unauthorized work.Tougher copyright rules would be a win for Hollywood and the music industry, which say their businesses are being ravaged by online piracy. But Internet companies are warning the U.S. position could undermine America's advantage in digital trade, which accounts for a large part of the nation's exports in services.The U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment.The copyright debate has flown under the radar as Mexico, Canada and business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce push back against aggressive proposals by the U.S. aimed at reducing the nation's trade deficit and rebuilding its manufacturing sector. The talks that began in August have failed to yield a breakthrough on the toughest issues. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal if the U.S. doesn't get what it wants.Tech industry groups were pleased with the copyright provisions in TPP, a deal with 11 Asia-Pacific nations from which the U.S. withdrew in January. The agreement had committed the nations to striking ??balance?? in enforcing copyright, and providing safe harbor to ISPs.America's leadership in the digital economy and the nation's digital-trade surplus depends ??on policies that put American digital exporters in the best position to succeed,?? said Ari Giovenco, director of trade and international policy at the Internet Association, whose members include Google, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc.In a submission to the U.S. government in June, the Motion Picture Association of America called copyright the ??lifeblood?? of the film and TV industry and said Nafta, which came into effect in 1994, isn't equipped to deal with the growth of online commerce. The association cautioned U.S. negotiators against mimicking safe-harbor language in U.S. law, which it said has been erroneously interpreted by American courts. Instead, the U.S. should promote ??high-level language?? with ??appropriate?? limits on liability, the group said.??Creators and innovators should be fairly rewarded for their work,?? said Brian Pomper, executive director of Action for Trade, a coalition of trade associations representing companies including movie studios, music labels and pharmaceutical firms that want strong intellectual-property protections in Nafta.??Canada's longstanding approach on IP has been to ensure a proper balance between the interests of creators and users of copyright material, with due consideration to a broad range of objectives, including the need to account for the role of Internet third parties,?? said Adam Austen, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

But few in the invitation-only crowd last Saturday at the annual Alfalfa Club gala could have guessed that the men were quietly closing in on what could be the answer to a question that divides the nation: How do we fix American health care?Their appearance together at the Capital Hilton capped years of discussions, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. When they saw one another at social gatherings or industry conferences, the conversation inevitably steered toward their shared frustration over the impact of medical expenses on their companies' bottom lines.On Tuesday, Amazon.com Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced a joint venture designed to do something about the problem they'd been chewing over for so long. They took the unusual step of issuing a mission statement -- use technology to fix health care for their combined 1 million workers, and possibly all Americans -- before even finding someone to head the effort. That search, aided by the free publicity of the announcement itself, has just begun, the person said.Read more: Who could lead a health-care company for three billionaires?After settling on a leader and deciding where the joint venture will be based, the initial focus will be on software solutions to provide U.S. employees and their families with simple, high-quality and transparent health care at reasonable costs. Echoing a critique of Silicon Valley itself, the enterprise will be free from the need to turn a profit, the companies said.The conversations between the billionaires might never have reached this stage had it not been for Todd Combs, the Berkshire investment officer who is one of the three executives tasked with helping create the endeavor. Combs, 47, was instrumental in getting the project to this phase, the person familiar with the situation said.A former hedge-fund manager who has been handed increased responsibilities at Berkshire Hathaway, Combs has been a JPMorgan board member since 2016. He also knows Bezos.While the companies shared the limelight in the announcement, it was Amazon that captured imaginations, and stirred up concerns, with its first step into the health-care sector after months of speculation that the behemoth might make an entry. The shares of health-care stocks from Express Scripts Holding Co. to CVS Health Corp. sank on the news.Read more: Biotech stocks fear Bezos more than Trump as costs targetedWhile details are scant, the Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan collaboration will likely pressure profits for middlemen in the health-care supply chain. Potential ways to bring down costs include providing more transparency in prices for doctor visits and lab tests, and by enabling direct purchasing of some medical items, the person said.The risk for incumbents is that Amazon, ??as a consumer oriented company, can develop a more customer-friendly experience as health care today is difficult to manage,?? said Kevin Fischbeck, a Bank of America Corp. analyst.Of course, issuing a press release is easy. Now comes the hard work of trying to change an entrenched and exceedingly complex market. Whoever leads the venture will have to form relationships with drugmakers, hospitals, insurers, regulators, pharmacy benefit managers and other stakeholders. Any impact is likely to be least three to five years away, according to Bank of America.Not everyone agrees there ever will be an impact. ??Many have tried but few have succeeded,?? said Sarah James, a Piper Jaffray health services analyst. ??We do not expect this joint venture to be a meaningful disruptor to the industry, despite the stock reaction indicating that it is.??Successful or not, it will be a new model in an arena where the public and private sectors have struggled mightily, a project by powerful companies with close ties. JPMorgan uses Amazon for its cloud computing services and the bank issues Amazon-branded credit cards, for example.Dimon has spoken glowingly of Buffett and fashioned his letters to shareholders after those the legendary investor writes. The banker often cites Bezos's approach to disruption.??Remember, Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity,?? Dimon said at his last shareholder meeting. ??When we see valid investments to make, we will make them.???? With assistance by Noah Buhayar, Katherine Chiglinsky, and Spencer Soper"

The firms share the same chief executive officer.Tether's coins have become a popular substitute for dollars on cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, with about $2.3 billion of the tokens outstanding as of Tuesday. While Tether has said all of its coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve, the company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of its holdings to the public or have its accounts audited. Skeptics have questioned whether the money is really there.??We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations,?? Bitfinex and Tether said Tuesday in an emailed statement. ??It is our policy not to comment on any such requests.??Erica Richardson, a CFTC spokeswoman, declined to comment.Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, tumbled 10 percent on Tuesday. It fell another 3.2 percent to $9,766.41 as of 9:19 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to composite pricing on Bloomberg.?The virtual currency hasn't closed below $10,000 since November.See also: Mystery shrouds Tether and its links to Bitcoin exchangeWhile Tether and Bitfinex don't disclose on their websites or in public documents where they're located or who's in charge, Ronn Torossian, a spokesman for the firms, said in a Dec. 3 email that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of both. Phil Potter is a Tether director, according to documents -- dubbed the Paradise Papers -- recently leaked by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. He's also the chief strategy officer at Bitfinex.Last year, Wells Fargo & Co. ended its role as a correspondent bank through which customers in the U.S. could send money to bank accounts held by Bitfinex and Tether in Taiwan. The firms sued the lender, but later withdrew the complaint. Torossian previously declined to identify the banks used by Bitfinex unless a non-disclosure agreement was signed, which Bloomberg News refused.While little public information exists about how tethers are created, market pricing suggests traders believe that each coin is worth $1. Trading the token for Bitcoin at Bitfinex has helped drive up Bitcoin prices, Barry Leybovich, a product manager at IPC Systems Inc. who creates risk and compliance products for financial institutions interested in blockchain applications, said last month.A document on Tether's website, compiled by accounting firm Friedman LLP, shows it had $443 million and 1,590 euros ($1,970) in bank accounts as of Sept. 15. Tether tokens were valued at $420 million that day, according to Coinmarketcap.com. Tether hasn't identified the banks where that money was held, and their names were blacked out in the document.Friedman said in its report that it didn't investigate the reliability of Tether's records. The accounting firm and Tether have recently cut ties, Tether said in a separate statement Monday.??Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable timeframe,??

But this time he was competing against a new rival -- Facebook Inc., which offered $600 million to stream the matches.Rupert MurdochFox eventually agreed in early September to pay $2.55 billion for TV and streaming rights for five years. But Facebook's ambitions weren't lost on Murdoch, 86, who had already begun contemplating the idea of selling major parts of Fox's media empire to a bigger rival to create a stronger competitor in an increasingly costly entertainment industry.Facebook's bid for the cricket was a ??warning shot?? that the digital giant was ??coming at sport,?? Murdoch said in an interview on Fox Business Network on Thursday. Meanwhile, Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have been spending lavishly to build a library of popular programs, creating a war for talent for networks like Fox's FX.??We're pivoting at a pivotal moment,?? he told Sky News.Murdoch and Iger sowed the seeds for the deal on a summer evening at the Australian-born billionaire's 13-acre Moraga Estate vineyard in Los Angeles. The pair, who have been in close contact in part because of their joint ownership of streaming service Hulu, discussed the disruptive forces tearing through the industry and talked about what the future might look like for their respective businesses.??I left thinking that there might be an opportunity for us to do something with him,?? Iger told Bloomberg TV on Thursday.As well as figuring out how best to bolster their defenses against digital rivals, succession planning was another driving force in the deal, said people familiar with the matter. Iger, who extended his contract by two years until 2021 to help implement the deal, now has the option of tapping James Murdoch to take over the reins. That could potentially solve the issue for Murdoch as well, leaving his other son, Lachlan, to run the remainder of the family empire.The Disney boss followed up with a phone call within weeks after the summit at the winery, and, by the start of October, the two firms were working with advisers on a potential deal that Murdoch says takes the business ??back to our roots, which is news and sports.??Bob IgerIger admitted that he hadn't envisioned such a transaction being possible a year ago -- or even six months ago.But for Murdoch, it's ??strategically the right time and the right move.??"
Toshiba Exorcises Westinghouse Ghost With Sale to Brookfield,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-05/toshiba-exorcises-westinghouse-ghosts-with-sale-to-brookfield,"January 4, 2018, 9:15 PM EST",technology,,"Little more than a year after flagging multi-billion dollar writedowns that threatened its very survival, Toshiba Corp. has gained some closure with the sale of its former nuclear unit Westinghouse Electric Co.Westinghouse was put into bankruptcy by Toshiba in March after project delays crippled earnings from the nuclear plant business. On Thursday, Brookfield Business Partners LP agreed to buy what remains of its U.S. business out of bankruptcy, as well as its non-bankrupt European business, for $4.6 billion.Toshiba bought Westinghouse for $5.4 billion in 2006 as a way to diversify away from consumer electronics, but struggled to build new reactors and was wrong-footed by changes in the nuclear industry. That includes the impact of Japan's 2011 Fukushima meltdown and a flood of cheap natural gas in the U.S. While it's unclear what benefit the Tokyo-based company will see from a sale, it will help Toshiba move on in the eyes of investors.??In terms of its image, this is a positive. Westinghouse has been a ghost that haunted Toshiba for a long time, so to be rid of that can be interpreted as positive,?? said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities. ??But in terms of Toshiba's fundamentals you can't say this has much impact.""Shares of Toshiba rose 2.2 percent to 330 yen in Tokyo on Friday. The company posted a net loss of 966 billion yen ($8.6 billion) last fiscal year, largely on the impact of the Westinghouse debacle.??The decision on the buyer for Westinghouse is good news for all creditors, including ourselves,?? Toshiba spokesman Ryoji Shinohara said in response to an inquiry by Bloomberg News. ??We believe the recovery of Westinghouse will move forward through the U.S. bankruptcy court proceedings.""Westinghouse is the first foray into the nuclear sector for Brookfield. The company has a plan to reorganize the bankrupt U.S. assets, according to a person with knowledge of the sale.?The deal, which still needs court and regulatory approval, was reached Wednesday night, said the person, speaking on condition of anonymity because some details are not yet public.Brookfield's Big Nuclear Bet Isn't as Bold as All That: GadflyThe sale marks a positive turn in a long saga of financial woes that led to the bankruptcy and also battered U.S. utilities that had taken on their construction.??Brookfield's acquisition of Westinghouse reaffirms our position as the leader of the global nuclear industry,?? Westinghouse Chief Executive Officer Jose Emeterio Gutierrez said in a statement on Thursday. He said the deal will transform the company into a stronger, more streamlined business.Since filing for bankruptcy in March, Westinghouse has said it will?no longer take on the risk of building new atomic facilities, and will instead specialize?in servicing reactors and selling designs.The deal includes Westinghouse's business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which had remained outside of bankruptcy protection, while at the same time drawing on some of the financing that the bankrupt units obtained from Apollo Global Management LLC.Westinghouse had harbored hopes of up-ending the industry with the AP1000 reactor, which was developed to be safer than reactors of old. The design was supposed to?revive an industry plagued by the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979. Instead, delays and overruns led to troubles that left Toshiba fighting for survival last year after writing down?the value of the unit by billions.??All in all, I think the Westinghouse adventure was very costly to Toshiba,?? said Lake Barrett, an independent nuclear consultant and?former official at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.??

Spotify Files to Go Public on New York Stock Exchange,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-03/spotify-is-said-to-file-to-go-public-on-new-york-stock-exchange,"January 3, 2018, 10:52 AM EST",technology,"""Music provider is said to file documents to put shares on NYSE"", ""Company would be most prominent to attempt a direct listing""","Spotify filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange, according to a person familiar with the matter, in the highest-profile test yet of a technique that lets companies list shares without raising money through a traditional stock offering.With steady cash from more than 60 million paying subscribers, the world's largest paid music-streaming service doesn't need more funding. Instead of an initial public offering, it's trying a direct listing, which essentially lets private stakeholders start trading their shares on a public exchange. That avoids underwriting fees and restrictions on stock sales by current owners, and doesn't dilute the holdings of executives and investors.Spotify, which has been valued at about $15 billion, would be the most prominent company by far to attempt a direct listing, a method that until now has been used by small issuers and real estate investment trusts. It would also be a first for the New York Stock Exchange, which has sought permission from the Securities & Exchange Commission to change its rules for the occasion.Spotify sent confidential documents to the SEC in late December with the aim of listing its shares in the first quarter of this year, said the person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Axios reported the filing earlier Wednesday.Non-public filings have become more common since July, when the SEC begin letting all companies file early IPO or stock-listing regulatory documents confidentially -- a perk previously reserved for smaller businesses. The initial privacy is meant to make the listing process more efficient and encourage more companies to go public. Spotify may be able to keep the documents private until at least 15 days before the share offering is effective.If the operation is successful, it could pave the way for other big tech companies, such as Airbnb and Uber, if they decide to go public and current investors don't want their stakes diluted.The move has its risks. Without underwriters, Spotify shares won't debut with a price based on investor feedback, with buyers lined up. An unusual format can also cause unforeseen problems, as Google discovered in its 2004 Dutch-auction IPO.Investors have few opportunities to invest directly in the music business, which is in the early stages of a recovery from years ravaged by piracy and a steep decline in CD sales. Online radio service Pandora Media Inc. has struggled to grow in recent years, a red flag for potential investors. But unlike Pandora, Spotify has persuaded tens of millions of people to pay a monthly fee.Spotify is led by Daniel Ek, a Swedish entrepreneur who co-founded the company and has since recruited a U.S.-based leadership team. While the company is the market leader in music streaming, it faces growing competition from tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.Spotify hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Allen & Co. last year to assess its options for a public offering. The company has already raised more than $1 billion in equity and obtained a $1 billion convertible loan from investors led by TPG in March 2016.The conversion was tied to a public offering, with the terms growing more favorable to TPG the longer that takes. By choosing a direct listing instead, Spotify will have to reach a new agreement with the private-equity company.Spotify took a major step toward the public offering last year by signing long-term licensing deals with all three major record labels, permitting them for the first time to keep some songs restricted only to paying subscribers. The streaming-music provider also settled a class-action suit last year with songwriters seeking royalties, though some parties were unhappy with the deal and have subsequently filed objections."
Nissan's Car of the Future Will Read Your Brain Waves,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-03/brain-waves-will-make-nissan-s-car-of-the-future-a-better-ride,"January 3, 2018, 5:00 AM EST",technology,"""Nissan to showcase ‘brain-to-vehicle' concept at CES next week"", ""Skullcap with wires will help car anticipate drivers' actions""","The world's biggest carmakers and technology companies are spending billions of dollars to perfect your ability to drive without thinking. Nissan Motor Co. is taking a different direction -- trying to ??decode?? your thinking so hands-on driving is more fun.The Japanese company will unveil and test its ??brain-to-vehicle?? technology at next week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The ??B2V?? system requires a driver to wear a skullcap that measures brain-wave activity and transmits its readings to steering, acceleration and braking systems that can start responding before the driver initiates the action.The driver still turns the wheel or hits the gas pedal, but the car anticipates those movements and begins the actions 0.2 seconds to 0.5 seconds sooner, said Lucian Gheorghe, a senior innovation researcher at Nissan overseeing the project. The earlier response should be imperceptible to drivers, he said.??We imagine a future where manual driving is still a value of society,?? said Gheorghe, 40, who earned a doctorate in applied neural technology. ??Driving pleasure is something as humans we should not lose.??Test drive of Nissan's brain-to-vehicle technology (B2V) in Atsugi, Japan.Carmakers are working on ways to keep driving relevant as newcomers such as Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo and Apple Inc. try to upend the industry with fully autonomous technologies. IHS Markit expects 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold annually by 2035 -- equivalent to about a quarter of all current vehicle sales.Many manufacturers, including Toyota Motor Corp. and BMW AG, say they won't give full control to computers and plan to continue building cars with distinct driving characteristics.Yokohama-based Nissan, maker of the Leaf electric vehicle, plans to introduce fully autonomous cars in 2022. Besides predicting drivers' movements, the skullcap also could detect their preferences and discomfort when the vehicle is in autonomous mode, prompting systems to adjust accordingly.A simulator test of Nissan's B2V technology.Yet, drivers of autonomous vehicles still will be able to flip a switch and take manual control of the car. That's where Nissan's brain-to-vehicle system comes into play.??You are feeling either that you are a better driver or the car is more sporty and more responsive,?? said Gheorghe, who uses the system himself for 15 minutes a day while commuting to work.The technology, which Nissan said is exclusive, will be included in fully autonomous cars and should be ready in five to 10 years, the company said. The prototype resembles a cap that would be worn while gaming or undergoing medical testing, with wires coming out of the top.Brain wave monitors also are being used by BHP Billiton Ltd., the world's biggest mining company, to check if its truck drivers are fatigued. The Australian company uses a six-inch strip fitted inside caps and helmets.Gheorghe's motivation comes from the enjoyment he experienced at age 18 after his father bought him a Nissan Fairlady Z.??There are many ways you can contribute to society -- I chose this one,?? said Gheorghe, who's worked at Nissan for 12 years.He was adamant that the skullcap isn't reading a driver's mind. Rather, it's detecting and then decoding brain activity that can occur about two seconds before a voluntary movement.??It's not about reading thoughts,?? he said. ??But before you move your body, we know you will move.??Nissan will demonstrate the technology at CES using its IMx electric concept car, which Gheorghe said is ??brain-connectivity ready.?? People from the audience will simulate driving on a highway for a few minutes, and the car should make adjustments in real time.Automakers have flocked to CES in recent years to demonstrate their most advanced technologies in artificial intelligence and smart cars. Last year, Toyota showed a concept that can sense your emotion, and Daimler AG displayed an electric van with a drone on top that automatically fetches and delivers packages.Test drive of Nissan's B2V technology.Nissan, which spent about 490 billion yen ($4.4 billion), or 4.2 percent of its revenue, on research and development in fiscal year 2016, is more aggressive than Toyota and Honda Motor Co. in drawing up timelines for autonomous vehicles.Nissan plans to allow cars to change lanes on highways autonomously this year and to navigate city roads and intersections without human interference by about 2020.??Even in autonomous driving, we are not building boxes in which you are sleeping,?? Gheorghe said. ??We are building a positive-experience delivering vehicle.??"
Sprint Hires Cost-Cutter Combes in Sign of Coming Tough Slog,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-04/sprint-hires-former-altice-ceo-combes-to-be-president-and-cfo,"January 4, 2018, 9:16 AM EST",business,"""The industry veteran resigned as Altice CEO in November"", ""His hire does little to placate investors as shares plunge""","Sprint Corp. is signaling tough times lie ahead.The telecommunications company hired industry veteran Michel Combes, known as a cost-cutter, as president and chief financial officer to help revive the telecommunications company still reeling from the collapse of?deal talks with T-Mobile US Inc. in November. Sprint shares plunged as as much as 6.8 percent, the most intraday since the end of the T-Mobile negotiations.Sprint, a unit?of SoftBank Group Corp., hasn't had a profitable year in a decade and needs to find a new path to growth now that it can no longer bank on a merger. Competition for new subscribers is tough, and the carrier is having to increase network spending by as much as 50 percent to catch up with rivals and capitalize on its industry-leading supply of airwaves.??Combes is likely to embark on a new cost-cutting plan now that a T-Mobile deal is off,'' said Walt Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG LLC. Combes will likely reduce the workforce even though Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son?won praise from President Donald Trump when he announced plans a year ago to hire 5,000 workers in the U.S., Piecyk said.Investors have punished Sprint shares since the merger was taken off the table, leaving the stock down by more than a third over the past year. The shares dropped 3.9 percent to $5.67 at 1:40 p.m. in New York, after declining to as low as $5.50.Combes replaces Tarek Robbiati, who will leave the company at the end of the month. During Robbiati's two-year run, Sprint cut 2,500 jobs, slashed capital expenditures about 36 percent last fiscal year and borrowed billions using assets like airwave licenses as collateral. That ??Hail Mary?? financing strategy helped stem losses and reduce subscriber defections, making Sprint stable enough for Son to explore merger options. Sprint has about 28,000 employees.Combes resigned from Altice NV in November after little more than a year as chief executive officer as investors grew unsettled?about the ability of billionaire Patrick Drahi's phone and cable company to reduce its net debt of about 49.6 billion euros ($60 billion). He will start at Sprint on Jan. 6, according to a statement Thursday.The 55-year-old Combes, with more than 25 years in telecommunications, has a strong track record of reducing expenses. He was hired to do just that about a decade ago at Vodafone Group Plc, then at network equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent SA and more recently at Altice. He started his career at French mobile-phone tower company TDF and later became Orange SA's CFO.At Vodafone, Combes oversaw a $3 billion cost-cutting program, reducing headcount and lowering spending on network gear and logistics. Leading up to a takeover by Nokia Oyj, Combes revamped Alcatel-Lucent by cutting costs, restructuring research labs and renegotiating debt, as well as slashing thousands of jobs to revive a company he said had neared bankruptcy.People who have worked with Combes say he's a workaholic, with a habit of calling his executive team in for early Sunday morning meetings and setting tight deadlines.?But Combes has also accumulated career mishaps. His stint at Altice lasted barely more than a year after restructuring at French unit SFR was too slow to pay off.Combes' two-year run as Alcatel-Lucent CEO, which ended with the sale of the telecom-gear maker to Nokia, was clouded by debates over the executive's multimillion-dollar bonus package that came after a run of firings and cost cuts. The company ended up slashing Combes's pay after it was criticized for being excessive by politicians including then-Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, who's now president.?At Sprint, Combes will get a salary of $1.5 million, with a target bonus of twice that amount. He also gets initial stock-based awards valued at $2.5 million, some of which are tied to performance, and a $600,000 relocation bonus.?He'll also get a ??turnaround incentive award?? of 3 million shares that will be earned depending on the company's stock performance by 2022. Beginning in April, his equity awards will be set at a value of $5 million.Combes has had experience with Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure and he brings a European outlook to the U.S. market, said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics LLC. The European telecommunications market is crowded with mobile prices on average well below U.S. Levels.Many of Sprint's recent hires have been executives from outside the U.S. to bring a fresh look at how to run the business, Entner said.???The only way for a No. 4 player to have a chance to improve is by changing the rules of the game,'' Entner said.??Combes will sharpen the pencil and remove more expenses,'' Entner said, adding that???it is obvious, by making Combes president, that they are setting him up as the second in command behind Claure.''Altice's U.S. unit, which operates the Cablevision and Suddenlink cable networks in parts of the U.S., and Sprint entered an agreement in November that allows the cable operator to sell wireless service using Sprint's network. As part of the agreement, Sprint will use Altice's broadband infrastructure to strengthen its nationwide network.Drahi has hinted that he'd be interested in acquiring a wireless business in the U.S., though BTIG's Piecyk said he's not interpreting the hiring of Combes as a prelude to a deal."

He continues to hold shares in line with corporate guidelines.??According to filings, on Nov. 29, Krzanich exercised and sold?644,135 options and sold an additional 245,743 shares that he already owned.

AMD Projects Revenue Gains With Limited Margin Expansion,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/amd-projects-revenue-gains-without-margin-expansion,"January 30, 2018, 4:45 PM EST",technology,"""Sales estimated to rise about 31 percent in the first quarter"", ""Company introduced new products in competition with Intel""","Advanced Micro Devices Inc., trying to make a dent in Intel Corp.'s dominance of computer processors, projected revenue will grow more quickly than some analysts had estimated, but gave a disappointing forecast for profitability.First-quarter revenue will be about $1.55 billion, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. That indicates growth of about 31 percent from an adjusted total of $1.18 billion for the same period a year earlier and compares with an average analyst estimate for a 27 percent increase, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Last year, AMD released new designs for desktop, server and laptop processors, saying that some outperform products from Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker. Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su touted the chips as the best AMD has produced in years and promised to win back share lost to Intel over the last decade. Investors, who pushed up the stock 295 percent in 2016 in anticipation of those gains, have become concerned that progress will be slower than hoped. Su said AMD's accelerating growth is evidence that those new offerings are gaining sales.??The new product strength is the most important factor,?? she said on a conference call with analysts. Su maintained her commitment to forging ahead with updating AMD's offerings,?in response to questions on the company's profitability. ??We are investing in key new products and new software and that's the right thing to do,?? she said.The company said gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, will be greater than 36 percent for 2018. That sparked concerns that AMD has increased the pace of its spending to keep up with larger rivals Intel and Nvidia Corp. Intel reported a gross margin of 63 percent in the fourth quarter.??That's what I was afraid of, that it's spending too much to compete with Intel and Nvidia,?? said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy.AMD's shares were little changed in extended trading, recovering from a decline of as much as 7.7 percent after the results were announced. The stock closed at $12.87 in New York and has gained 25 percent this year.Fourth-quarter net income was $61 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with a loss a year earlier. Sales rose 34 percent to $1.48 billion. Profit minus certain items was 8 cents a share. Analysts had projected profit on that basis of 5 cents a share on revenue of $1.41 billion.AMD is also the second-largest maker of graphics processors for add-in cards for PCs used by gamers, behind Nvidia. That market has been boosted sporadically by sales related to cryptocurrency mining. Graphics chips are good at the kind of processing needed for such activity.Su is trying to restore AMD's fortunes after years when its products either came too late or fell short of promises. She has repaired its balance sheet and revamped the entire product lineup. A new design for laptops, the biggest area of PCs by volume, was released in the fourth quarter.AMD's earnings may also provide a window into how the computer industry is reacting to news earlier this month that a feature of all modern processors makes them vulnerable to the theft of information previously thought to be secure. Intel, AMD and software makers have been rushing to deliver software patches to close off that potential avenue of attack from hackers. Some of those patches have slowed computers or caused older ones to have issues such as unscheduled restarts."
Russia's Largest Phone Carrier Is Taking on Uber,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/largest-russian-phone-carrier-takes-on-uber-in-push-to-diversify,"December 11, 2017, 9:00 PM EST",technology,"""Target is 10% of sales from services other than voice, data"", ""MTS sees Russian phone market as stable, with no price wars""","Mobile TeleSystems PJSC is offering online taxi hailing and medical appointments over video, as Russia's largest mobile carrier pursues new apps for revenue growth amid stiff wireless price competition.The carrier made an speedy foray into Russia's taxi business in October after Uber Technologies Inc. in July agreed to merge its operations into a joint venture with rival Yandex NV. That digital service and others could make up 10 percent of MTS's sales in a few years and probably more than half of revenue in the longer term, Vyacheslav Nikolaev, the company's head of marketing, said in an interview in Moscow.??We saw an opportunity to enter the taxi market once competition weakened,?? Nikolaev said. ??After Yandex acquired Uber's business in Russia and ride prices rose, we thought there could be room for another serious player on the market.??Carriers globally, struggling to grow revenues with cheap prices for voice calls and generous data offerings, are branching out into businesses where they can capitalize on their millions of customers. BT Group Plc has invested in sports rights, while Vodafone Group Plc is betting on connecting machines and Orange SA is offering banking. Investors are being cautious about the new opportunities, with the models still unproven.??No wireless carrier has been so far able to generate a meaningful part of revenue outside of voice and data,?? said Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie Capital in Moscow. ??The success of MTS's push into digital services will depend on the partners it chooses.??MTS runs more than 20 of its own mobile apps, including an online-wallet, and more traditional apps for music and TV. For its ride-hailing app, MTS has partnered in a revenue-sharing agreement with City Mobil, an taxi operator that's big in Moscow and St. Petersburg. MTS's cashback service connects to over 100 retail partners that return a portion of the purchase price to the phone accounts of users who select them through an MTS app.??Given that wireless tariffs in Russia are among the lowest in the world, large purchases may allow users to cover their wireless bill for several months,"" Nikolaev said.MTS will continue to reduce its retail network, which now has 5,700 stores, once its competitors follow suit, Nikolaev said. The optimal number of stores would be about 2,500 each for the Russian carriers in the mid-term, he said.There's also some relief in MTS's main wireless business, which has been growing for several quarters, according to Nikolaev. Russia's other major mobile carriers, MegaFon PJSC and Veon Ltd., also saw domestic growth in the latest quarter after the country's economy rebounded from the worst recession in two decades.MTS shares are down about 2.4 percent year-to-date for a market value of 505 billion rubles ($8.5 billion). Veon's U.S. depositary receipts have declined about 0.8 percent, while MegaFon stock has lost about 10 percent in Moscow.The trio have been more restrained in offering bundled tariffs with aggressive pricing in a boon to the industry after years of selling more minutes and data at rates that were little changed. Although MegaFon recently expressed concerns that price wars may resume, Nikolaev doesn't agree, saying MTS made routine adjustments to tariff plans in nine of Russia's regions that don't affect Russia as a whole.??There are no price wars,?? he said.???There is an economic recovery, and we see that people are eager to consume more and pay more for it. Our revenue will be at least stable, and I don't see any reason for average revenue per user to decline in general on the Russian market.??"

A 10-minute video of Bill Murray clowning around in an astronomy classroom. Seven minutes of a reality-show couple arguing about getting their young son a pet snake. Three minutes of animated arachnids explaining how female spiders ward off unwanted sexual advances. It's enough to send even an exhausted insomniac looking for a more productive use of time.Facebook Watch is the company's nascent effort to carve out a dedicated space on its service for videos??just videos??of several minutes to half an hour or more. That may not sound radical, but it would offer users a big shift from their typical Facebook habit, a mindless scroll through all kinds of personalized flotsam with a rare pause to watch a few seconds of video in the feed. Facebook Inc. wants its 2 billion users to think of Watch as an entertainment destination, with web series compelling enough to bring people back for weekly installments packaged with ad breaks, just like conventional TV.The company has yet to hit on the right formula. After four months, it's already rejiggering its strategy, winnowing dozens of would-be shows and pumping up production budgets for those that remain. It's a more targeted plan than last year's experiments with Facebook Live, but several days of wallowing in Watch videos suggests that, for now, it's almost as unruly. There are a lot of videos indistinguishable from YouTube offerings, a little cable TV, a dash of Netflix, and pinches of classic Facebook.Facebook Vice President of Product?Fidji Simo says the Watch programming and ad strategies are evolving as the team and its partners get a better idea of the kinds of shows that will draw people together. ??We&apos;re a company that iterates a lot,???she says. ??We're going to have to figure it out with partners.?? The company wouldn't share viewership numbers.Watch is a separate page on Facebook's website and a separate tab in its app, each denoted by a logo of a play button on a screen. Publishers including BuzzFeed, Cosmopolitan, and National Geographic produce the videos, with Facebook paying the bills for a few. Judging from a sample of dozens of Watch videos, however, they seem less than carefully selected. A 90-second New York Times tutorial on searing steaks appeared next to a pro video game match that ran for three hours. For every legitimately cool clip??say, football player Marshawn Lynch smooshing a car with a tank??there's a cringeworthy Bachelor ripoff.Among the highlights was Strangers, a fictional series about a 30ish Los Angeles woman working through an identity crisis with the help of people who rent her spare room. Mostly the programs were????fine. Few touched on news events or other unpleasant realities. ??It's Facebook trying to figure out what form of video people want to watch,?? says Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst for researcher EMarketer.The offerings so far illustrate that Facebook's determination to shift toward video, long a priority for Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, is meant to grab more ad money. But besides the bottom line, Watch is also part of Zuckerberg's promise to make Facebook a home for what he calls ??meaningful social interaction.?? The idea is that people who love surfing, for example, can bond over Watch's surfing videos. Morgan Stanley estimates that Watch could grab the average North American Facebook user's eyeballs for about 20 minutes a day next year. But so far, there's little evidence of that virtual water cooler effect.Facebook's efforts are joining a crowded scrum, with traditional networks trying to embrace online video, Netflix and Amazon investing heavily in their own programming, and shows sort of like what's on TV coming from YouTube, Apple, Twitter, and Snapchat. (Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg Businessweek, is developing a global breaking-news network for the Twitter service.)An executive at a company that creates programs for Facebook Watch says most of the viewers aren't new and instead are existing fans of his brand. The executive, who requested anonymity to discuss the partnership, says he's annoyed that Facebook used publishers as guinea pigs before figuring out how to sell ads against the videos. During our days of sampling Watch videos, not a single ad appeared. Simo?says that while most Watch viewers see the videos in their standard?news feeds, rather than using?Watch to find new stuff, changing audience habits takes time.It's oddly comforting that even Facebook hasn't quite figured out its video future. A dose of Strangers now and then might be comforting, too. But for now, at least, it's no substitute for a football game. On TV."
Why Crypto Traders Are So Worried About Tether,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/why-crypto-traders-are-so-worried-about-tether-quicktake-q-a,"January 31, 2018, 6:01 AM EST",quicktake,,"It's one of the most hotly debated questions in the world of virtual currencies: Is Tether telling the truth when it says that each of its digital tokens is backed by one U.S. dollar? News on Jan. 30 that American regulators are scrutinizing the company has given fresh ammunition to the skeptics.It's an issuer of a cryptocurrency with an unusual twist. Unlike Bitcoin, whose value fluctuates wildly from day to day, Tether's tokens are designed for stability. Prices for the coins have stayed near $1 because Tether says each one is backed by a dollar in its bank accounts.Many traders use them as a substitute for dollars. Tether's tokens are more easily transferable between cryptocurrency exchanges and other online platforms because they don't have to travel through the banking system. Stable prices have made the coins handy instruments for betting on the direction of other cryptocurrencies.While Tether has repeatedly said that its coins are fully backed by dollars, the company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of its holdings to the public or have its accounts audited. It recently cut ties with accounting firm?Friedman LLP. ??So far it has been a black box,?? said?Neelabh Dixit, co-founder of Cryptomover, a digital-currency investment company in Hong Kong. There are also questions about Tether's relationship with Bitfinex, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. Some market watchers have alleged that trading in Tether's tokens on Bitfinex has helped prop up Bitcoin prices.While the companies don't disclose on their websites or in public documents where they're located or who's in charge, Ronn Torossian, a spokesman for the firms, said in a Dec. 3 email that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the chief executive officer of both. Phil Potter is a Tether director, according to documents -- dubbed the Paradise Papers -- leaked by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. He's also the chief strategy officer at Bitfinex.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent subpoenas on Dec. 6 to Bitfinex and Tether, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. ??We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations,?? Bitfinex and Tether said in an emailed statement. ??It is our policy not to comment on any such requests.?? Erica Richardson, a CFTC spokeswoman, declined to comment.Not well. The market value of all cryptocurrencies tracked by Coinmarketcap.com dropped by almost $30 billion within an hour of the news breaking, while Bitcoin sank below the closely watched $10,000 level. Tether's coins have been more resilient. After a brief dip to around 98 cents, they've rebounded back toward $1, according to Coinmarketcap.com.Despite their relatively small total market value of about $2.2 billion, Tether's coins play an outsized role on cryptocurrency exchanges. They were the third-most traded among all digital currencies after Bitcoin and Ethereum during the past 24 hours, according to data compiled by Coinmarketcap.com.If authorities were to find any wrongdoing at Tether, the company's tokens could quickly lose value, said Peter Sin, co-founder of the Singapore Bitcoin Club. While only time will tell if the critics were right to be concerned, some market observers have applauded the CFTC's decision to take a closer look. ??A regulatory inquiry will be useful to put this to rest one way or another,?? said Urszula McCormack, a Hong Kong-based partner at King & Wood Mallesons, a law firm that has advised on initial coin offerings and blockchain projects.??

A year ago, Collibra raised about $50 million from the same investors.Founded in Brussels in 2008, but now also based in New York, Collibra builds computer programs to help large banks, health-care providers and manufacturing firms track their data. Collibra provides the piping to keep tabs on where data is coming from, who is using it, and if its use is compliant with industry rules and government policies.In the past few years, Collibra's sales have been bolstered by new privacy rules, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the banking industry's Basel Accords, which obligates businesses to document how they process information. Companies face substantial fines if they don't comply.Felix Van De Maele, the company's co-founder and chief executive officer, wants Collibra to become the leader for data governance software in the same way Salesforce.com Inc.'s software dominates sales and marketing and SAP SE's systems dominate finance and logistics. ""We believe data governance will be its own category within enterprise software,"" he said in an interview. ""And we think we can be the system of record for that category.""He said the company planned to use the latest funding round to hire more sales, engineering and product engineering staff in the U.S. and Europe. Collibra also plans to expand to Australia within the coming year, Van de Maele said.Iconiq, which also manages the family wealth of Facebook Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg and LinkedIn Corp.'s co-founder Reid Hoffman, says European startups, like Collibra, are catching the San Francisco-based fund's eye. ""European entrepreneurs must learn to build internationally at an early stage,"" said Iconiq general partner and Collibra board member Matt Jacobson. ""That's impressive."""
"Apple Plans Combined iPhone, iPad & Mac Apps to Create One User Experience",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps,"December 20, 2017, 9:30 AM EST",technology,"""Aim is to let developers expand iOS apps to Mac computers"", ""Apple customers have complained some Mac apps get short shrift""","Apple Inc.'s iPhone and iPad introduced a novel way of interacting with computers: via easy-to-use applications, accessible in the highly curated App Store.The same approach hasn't worked nearly as well on Apple's desktops and laptops. The Mac App Store is a ghost town of limited selection and rarely updated programs. Now Apple plans to change that by giving people a way to use a single set of apps that work equally well across its family of devices: iPhones, iPads and Macs.Starting as early as next year, software developers will be able to design a single application that works with a touchscreen or mouse and trackpad depending on whether it's running on the iPhone and iPad operating system or on Mac hardware,?according to people familiar with the matter.?Developers currently must design two different apps -- one for iOS, the operating system of Apple's mobile devices, and one for macOS, the system that runs Macs. That's a lot more work. What's more, Apple customers have long complained that some Mac apps get short shrift. For example, while the iPhone and iPad Twitter app is regularly updated with the social network's latest features, the Mac version hasn't been refreshed recently and is widely considered substandard. With a single app for all machines, Mac, iPad and iPhone users will get new features and updates at the same time.Unifying the apps could help the iOS and macOS platforms ??evolve and grow as one, and not one at the expense of the other,?? says Steven Troughton-Smith, an app developer and longtime voice in the Apple community. ??This would be the biggest change to Apple's software platform since iOS was introduced.??Apple is developing the strategy as part of the next major iOS and macOS updates, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter.?Codenamed ??Marzipan,?? the secret project is planned as a multiyear effort that will start rolling out as early as next year and may be announced at the company's annual developers conference in the summer. The plans are still fluid, the people said, so the implementation could change or the project could still be canceled.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Apple wouldn't be first to bring mobile and desktop apps closer together. Before it discontinued Windows software for smartphones, Microsoft Corp. pushed a technology called Universal Windows Platform that let developers create single applications that would run on all of its devices -- tablets, phones, and full-fledged computers. Similarly, Google has brought the Play mobile app store to some laptops running its desktop Chrome OS, letting computer users run smartphone and tablet apps like Instagram and Snapchat.It's unclear if Apple plans to merge the separate Mac and iOS App Stores as well, but it is notable that the version of the store running on iPhones and iPads was redesigned this year while the Mac version has not been refreshed since 2014.Apple's apps initiative is part of a larger, longer-term push to make the underpinnings of its hardware and software more similar. Several years ago, the company began designing its own processors for iOS devices. It has started doing the same for the Mac, recently launching a T2 chip in the iMac Pro that offloads features like security and power management from the main Intel processor onto Apple-designed silicon. Much the way Apple plans to unify apps, it could also one day use the same main processor on Macs and iOS devices.For more on Apple, check out the?Decrypted? podcast:That would make it easier to create a single operating system for all Apple gadgets. Will Apple go there? Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has resisted doing so, arguing that merging iOS and macOS would degrade the experience. ??You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user,?? Cook said in 2012. Apple software chief?Craig Federighi has called the blending of iOS and macOS ??a compromise.??Maybe so. But Apple has a long history of insisting it would never do something -- make a small iPad, say, or a big iPhone -- and then doing it anyway."

All About That Big Chip Security Weakness: QuickTake Q&A;,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-04/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-chip-security-problem,"January 3, 2018, 8:42 PM EST",quicktake,,"Intel Corp. said on Jan. 3 that most of the processors running the world's computers and smartphones have a feature that makes them susceptible to hacker attacks. The chipmaker, working with partners and rivals, says it has already issued updates?to protect most processor products introduced in the past five years, but the news sparked concern about this fundamental building block of the?internet, PCs and corporate networks.The revelation of the so-called?Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities spurred a scramble among technology's biggest players, from Apple Inc. to Amazon.com Inc., to enact fixes and reassure customers they were on top of the problem.Modern processors guess what they'll have to do next and fetch the data they think they'll need. That makes everything from supercomputers to smartphones operate very fast. Unfortunately, as Google researchers discovered, it also provides a way for bad actors to read data stored in memory that had been thought to be secure. In a worst-case scenario, that would let someone access your passwords.The vulnerability won't stop your computer working and doesn't provide an avenue for hackers to put malicious software on your machine. Though it could put important data at risk, there's been no report so far of anyone's computer being attacked in this manner. More broadly, though, the new fears could undermine longtime assurances that hardware and chip-level security is more tamper-proof than software.The weakness was discovered last year by folks Google employs to find such issues before the bad guys do. Usually, solutions are developed in private and announced in a coordinated way. This time the news leaked before the companies involved had a chance to get a fix in place.Chipmakers and operating system providers, such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Microsoft Corp., are rushing to create software patches that will close the potential window of attack. Intel said on Jan. 4 that by the end of next week, it expects to have issued updates for more than 90 percent of recently introduced processor products. Amazon.com Inc. said ??all but a small single-digit percentage?? of its servers have already been protected. In a blog post, Google said its security teams immediately ??mobilized to defend?? its systems and user data. Some customers of Android devices, Google Chromebook laptops and its cloud services still need to take steps to patch security holes, the company said. Patches for Windows devices are out now and the company is securing its cloud services, Microsoft said in a statement.No, though that seems to be what panicky investors initially thought. Intel says it's an issue for all modern processors. But rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. stated that its products are at ??near-zero risk.?? ARM Holdings, which has chip designs that support all smartphones, said?that, at worst, the vulnerability could ??result in small pieces of data being accessed?? and advised users of its technology to keep their software up to date. Google fingered all three companies. Apple said all Mac computers and iOS devices -- including iPhones and iPads -- were affected, but stressed there were no known exploits impacting users and that steps taken to address the issue haven't dented performance.Some computers, mostly older ones, could be slowed down by the software patches that will make them more secure. Intel said that in common situations software might be slowed down by as much as 3 percent or not at all. But in other rare situations, performance might be reduced as much as 30 percent. The company doesn't expect any financial impact and said it thinks customers will keep buying. As the fixes haven't been widely deployed yet, it's unclear whether anyone will even notice or whether computer slowdowns will be widespread. Intel has only done lab tests.??

Oracle Falls Most in 3 Months as Cloud Sales Drag on Turnaround,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/oracle-sales-top-estimates-on-growing-cloud-demand,"December 14, 2017, 4:17 PM EST",technology,"""Total cloud revenue rose 44%; new software licenses held firm"", ""Forecast also misses projections with slower cloud growth""","Oracle Corp. fell the most in three months after reporting cloud-computing sales that missed some analysts' estimates, a setback in the company's effort to remake itself around internet-based products.Cloud revenue in the period ended Nov. 30 gained 44 percent to $1.52 billion, Oracle said Thursday in a statement. John DiFucci, an analyst at Jefferies, was among those who projected stronger growth in Oracle's cloud sales, with his estimate of $1.55 billion. The company also gave a disappointing forecast for profit and cloud growth in the current period. Shares fell as much as 6.4 percent to $47 in New York Friday, the biggest intraday drop since Sept. 15.Oracle, a mainstay of traditional corporate computing software, is fighting to catch up in the newer cloud market with established leaders including Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The company has been hiring engineers to build products that let customers rent software and computing power from Oracle, and adding sales reps to transition businesses to the new offerings. The Redwood City, California-based company has also been making acquisitions like last year's $9 billion purchase of NetSuite Inc. to add cloud clients and programs.??They're late to that whole cloud battle,???said Patrick Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities. ??A lot of people already have a solution they are happy with. The question is what does Oracle bring the table???The company projected revenue growth from the internet-based products and services to be 21 percent to 25 percent in the fiscal third quarter. Profit, excluding some costs, will be 68 cents to 70 cents a share, below the average analyst estimate of 72 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The forecast doesn't take into account currency fluctuations that could boost profit as much as 3 cents a share, Co-Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said on a call with analysts.As Oracle tries to gain more customers in the rapidly growing cloud market, Amazon is adding products and services directly aimed at luring Oracle's traditional database customers to switch. At Amazon's annual cloud conference late last month, the market leader unveiled several new offerings for parsing and storing data and poked fun at Oracle's price increases. Oracle, meanwhile, offered conference attendees free Tesla rides, during which a sales representative regaled the rider with the benefits of Oracle's software.??Investors are thinking this is the next cloud transition story -- look what happened with Microsoft, look what happened with Adobe. That should happen with Oracle,?? Walravens said. The challenge for Oracle is that a lot of its business is in infrastructure, where Amazon and Microsoft already dominate the cloud market, he said.?At the same time, Oracle continues to sell traditional database and corporate programs that customers run on site. Revenue generated by new software licenses, a measure that's tied to those products, was little changed in the fiscal second quarter from a year earlier. That compares with a drop of 6.2 percent in the prior period.The company reported adjusted revenue rose 6.5 percent to $9.62 billion in the quarter.

Jia said in his Weibo post he would work with Leshi to resolve its issues and apologized for his companies' debt crisis. He said his brother met with regulators in person on Dec. 29 to discuss the matter.??I'm deeply sorry and I blame myself for the huge negative impact the debt crisis of LeEco has brought,?? he wrote. ??The financing of U.S.-based FF has made great progress and there is immense work that requires me to guarantee on-time mass production and delivery of FF 91 EV,?? he said, referring to the startup's prototype model.Leshi said in a filing Tuesday that it hasn't resolved its debt problems with closely held entities associated with Jia. The company also announced plans for a unit to buy LeEco's online business Lemall.com for 92.9 million yuan ($14 million), and raise about 3 billion yuan for its smart TV unit in financing that values the division at about 12 billion yuan.??Up to now, the parties haven't come to a substantial, executable solution to its overall debt issues,?? Leshi said in one of several filings to the Shenzhen exchange. ??The listed firm will continue?to do its utmost to engage Jia Yueting and the non-listed affiliated companies to reach resolution.??Leshi Internet remains the largest listed vehicle in Jia's LeEco empire but has been suspended from trade since April.?The success of Jia's forays into video-streaming encouraged LeEco to expand into new businesses, during which Jia borrowed heavily against equity in Leshi.In his Weibo post on Tuesday, Jia placed much of the blame for LeEco's subsequent cash-flow problems on a single late payment in July, which he said led to the freezing of his assets and triggered a cascade of early loan recalls. He also cited ??false and malicious?? reports that led to problems with creditors and suppliers.?? With assistance by David Ramli, Yuan Gao, Yan Zhang, and Qi Ding"
Facial Recognition for Cows Is Latest Cargill-Backed Tech Idea,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/facial-recognition-for-cows-is-latest-cargill-backed-tech-idea,"January 31, 2018, 1:25 PM EST",technology,,"Cargill Inc. is backing an Irish startup that uses facial recognition software to help increase the productivity of dairy cows, the latest move by the largest closely held U.S. company to bolster its agricultural-technology efforts.Cargill has taken a minority stake in Cainthus, which harnesses machine-learning and imaging techniques to identify cows and glean information on everything from their behavior to appetite, David Hunt, president and co-founder of Cainthus, said in a telephone interview Wednesday. Details of the investment weren't disclosed.Hunt said Dublin-based Cainthus chose Cargill over venture capital firms because of the U.S. company's footprint in agriculture. Cargill is still owned by the same family that founded it 153 years ago and it's one of the world's largest crop traders and meat producers.In the last few years, Minneapolis-based Cargill has reorganized parts of its business and built up a stronger presence in farm technology. It announced last month it's partnering with other companies to form a startup accelerator that will identify new food technologies. Cargill is seeking breakthroughs from other industries that can be applied to meet the big challenges in agriculture, such as population growth, labor shortages in rural areas, and consumers' concern over how their food is sourced and treated.It's a question of ""how do you do some of the same activities"" but ""in a more efficient manner,"" SriRaj Kantamneni, managing director of its digital insights business, said in an interview."
U.K. Retailers Get Black Friday Boost as Sales Jump 1.1%,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/u-k-retailers-get-black-friday-boost-as-sales-jump-1-1,"December 14, 2017, 4:30 AM EST",markets,"""Promotions spur sales of household electrical appliances"", ""Retail sales on course to contribute to GDP growth in quarter""","Black Friday gave U.K. retailers a stronger-than-expected boost last month as discounts spurred Britons to snap up electrical appliances and other household products.The volume of goods sold in stores and online jumped 1.1 percent from October, the most in seven months, the Office for National Statistics said Thursday. Sales excluding auto fuel rose 1.2 percent. The increases far exceeded the median forecasts of economists.Sales of household goods rose 2.9 percent and clothing sales climbed 1.4 percent. Non-store retailing, which includes online sales, saw a 2.6 percent increase. Food sales rose just 0.6 percent, as smaller stores claimed cold weather kept buyers away.The ONS survey period ended on Nov. 25, the day after Black Friday.The pound rose after the data were published and was trading at $1.3453 as of 9:32 a.m. in London, up 0.25 percent from a day earlier.The increase last month means sales will rise in the fourth quarter unless December sees a decline of more than 3 percent. The last time there was a bigger fall was in January 2010. Retail sales rose 1.6 percent from a year earlier in November.The ONS said seasonal adjustments capture only an element of the Black Friday effect, with retailers now offering discounts over a two-week period rather than a single day.The figures may do little to alter the underlying picture for the British consumer in the crucial Christmas shopping period.Brexit uncertainty, higher interest rates and the squeeze on living standards from rising prices are taking their toll. While inflation is expected to subside from its current level above 3 percent, wages may continue to lag behind for much of next year."
"As Topix Reclaims 26-Year High, Investors Bet on Tech Comeback",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/as-topix-reclaims-26-year-high-investors-bet-on-tech-comeback,"December 18, 2017, 11:00 AM EST",markets,"""Japan's ‘sunrise' stocks fell amid global technology selloff"", ""Citi Private Bank, BlackRock, Pictet see declines as fleeting""","As Japanese stocks overcame last month's downturn to return to their highest in 26 years, the rally found a new driver: bank shares, which took over from the technology companies that led the charge for most of 2017.Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., the country's largest lenders, were the biggest contributors to the Topix index's advance from mid-November, as the benchmark equity gauge recovered from a drop of more than 4 percent to close Monday at the highest since November 1991. Lenders came into favor as the Federal Reserve moved to raise interest rates, which helps their profitability, and investors dumped technology shares amid a global industry selloff.For some traders, that raised questions about the outlook for companies such as the so-called Sunrise stocks -- Sony Corp., Recruit Holdings Co., Nintendo Co. and SoftBank Group Corp. -- Japan's equivalent of the FANGs in the U.S., which provided much of the Tokyo market's joy in 2017. But for Citi Private Bank, those shares will make a comeback.Selling of technology stocks is ??going to be a temporary phenomenon,?? said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at the bank in Hong Kong. He pointed to the companies' potential for sustained strong earnings.Japanese technology shares have retreated since since last month as investors rotated out of the sector. Nintendo has lost almost 10 percent from its November high, while Sony is down 4.6 percent from its peak earlier that month. SoftBank, meanwhile, has slid 13 percent from its high on Oct. 30., hit harder than the others after e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc. said it would enter the telecommunications business. Only the staffing agency Recruit -- dubbed one of the Sunrise shares because of its human resources technology business -- has fully recovered, closing Monday at its highest on record.Despite those declines, Sony, Nintendo and Recruit are still three of the four biggest contributors to the Topix's advance this year. The fourth company is Keyence Corp., a maker of factory-automation equipment whose shares were also sold in November. They've surged an average of almost 70 percent this year, paving the way for Topix's best annual performance since 2013.There are reasons for Peng to be optimistic that the technology stock declines won't last. Sony raised its annual operating-profit outlook to a record last month on demand for high-end 4K televisions and wider use of camera chips. In October, Nintendo increased its forecast for sales of its Switch console to 14 million units from 10 million. And staffing-company Recruit has seen strong earnings in human resources technology, driven partly by Indeed Inc., the U.S. operator of a search engine for jobs that it required in 2012.As well as the Sunrise stocks, companies involved in the world of robots had been surging in 2017 before the November selloff. Even after that, Osaka-based maker of factory-automation sensors Keyence is up more than 60 percent this year, while Yaskawa Electric Co., which produces motors and controllers for industrial robots, has soared 170 percent. Investors have bought the companies' shares amid Japan's tightest labor market in decades.The world's largest money manager gave technology stocks a vote of confidence Monday, while saying it also likes financial shares. BlackRock Inc. said it remains overweight Japanese equities in general, citing a global economic recovery, ??solid?? earnings and ??relatively attractive?? valuations. The economy will probably continue to grow gradually, while its central bank is unlikely to alter its current super-easy monetary policy next year, it said.The Topix is up 20 percent in 2017, a year in which it was less dependent on the currency for its gains: the yen has fallen less than 4 percent against the dollar. Aside from November's declines, it's been a calmer year for the country's equities, with the Topix falling posting just one daily drop of more than 2 percent. Last year, it did so more than 20 times.Pictet Asset Management Ltd., which oversees almost $500 billion, agreed with BlackRock's assessment of which industries to buy, saying technology stocks will get over their slump and financial firms will continue their advance.??The broad overall trend hasn't changed,?? said Hiroshi Matsumoto, head of Japan investment at the money manager, who said he remains positive on Japanese equities. ??You either buy banks or technology stocks.????

The car companies, latecomers to the technology upending the sector, are exploring using the self-driving systems for taxi services, robotic deliveries and even in-car advertising.??This is a partnership of the century,?? Johann Jungwirth, Volkswagen's chief digital officer, said in a phone interview. ??I have full trust in the Aurora team.??The initiatives pit Hyundai and Volkswagen against other major automakers, Tesla Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo and ride-hailing firms, adding to a complex web of deals as manufacturers, suppliers and tech giants scramble to develop and take driverless vehicles to market. The partnerships also vault Aurora to the upper echelons of a slew of self-driving startups that have appeared in recent years.Chris UrmsonAurora has stood out to engineering specialists, investors and potential partners largely because of the cachet of its three founders: Chris Urmson, the longtime director of Google's car project, now called Waymo; Sterling Anderson, the former head of Tesla's Autopilot program;?and Drew Bagnell, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute and?a founding member of Uber Technologies Inc.'s Advanced Technologies Center.Tesla sued Anderson, now Aurora's chief product officer,?in January 2017 for breach of contract by joining Aurora, and subsequently dropped the lawsuit in April.Pittsburgh, home to Carnegie Mellon University, has long been the epicenter of robotics research and Aurora has a sizeable office there. Bagnell is Aurora's chief technical officer.Aurora now employs well over 70 people across two offices and Urmson said the company is hiring aggressively. One of the company's stated values is ""No jerks."" ""We debate and solve hard technical problems. We don't waste time battling over personalities and egos and we have no tolerance for time-wasters and nonsense,"" says the Aurora website.For the partnerships with Hyundai and Volkswagen, Aurora will work with them to outfit traditional vehicles with self-driving software and systems.The companies have grander plans, too: a test project in pilot smart cities with Hyundai, and driverless shuttles and delivery vans with Volkswagen. They didn't share financial terms of the initiatives.At Volkswagen, the Aurora deal marks a shift from a go-it-alone approach. The parent company, which owns high-end brands like Audi and Porsche, recently committed more than?34 billion euros over five years to develop electric and autonomous vehicle technology. Like other German auto companies, Volkswagen has largely opted to work on research internally rather than partnering with or acquiring tech companies, tactics other car giants have pursued.Volkswagen and Aurora will develop cars for Moia, the German automaker's electric ride-hailing network,?and the startup has been testing its self-driving systems with the Audi Q7 model, Jungwirth said. He also said Volkswagen may work with other companies on self-driving features in the future.Volkswagen SedricJungwirth declined to name additional Volkswagen group vehicles that could be involved, but said the cars may be used for delivery or become a ??huge advertising platform.??For Hyundai, Aurora will co-develop a self-driving electric car that runs on fuel cells,?Woongjun Jang, director of Hyundai's Advanced Driver Assistance System Development Group, said in a phone interview.Jang said the South Korean company plans to build and sell an autonomous vehicle powered by fuel cells. More details about the vehicle, an SUV, will be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week and Hyundai hopes to deploy it in 2021 as part of a fleet service, Jang said.As a late arrival to autonomous programs, Hyundai is speeding up the hunt for startups and information and communication technology companies.?Hyundai plans to work with several other companies beyond Aurora,?Jang said.John Krafcik, the CEO of Waymo who replaced Urmson, was formerly head of Hyundai's U.S. sales operation.??

Spotify declined to comment.Spotify, owner of the world's largest paid music service, settled a case with songwriters last year, a bid to end years of fighting ahead of its planned listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Many of the songwriters and their representatives, including Wixen, were unhappy with the settlement and have subsequently filed objections.Streaming services need to acquire licenses from the individual or group that recorded the song -- often held by a record label -- as well as the songwriters, whose rights are usually administered by a publisher. While Spotify had licensing deals with the biggest publishers, the lawsuit it settled last year involved smaller companies like Wixen that claimed they hadn't granted rights to the streaming-music provider.Songwriters are also in the process of trying to persuade federal judges to adopt a new standard for how streaming services pay them.??

Fobisuite Technologies Inc., which makes hardware that allows retailers to accept cryptocurrency as payment, is also part of the deal.??We've found an effective way of combining blockchain with big data and cannabis,?? said Cannabis Big Data Chief Executive Officer?Rob Anson in a statement Thursday. Glance Technologies shares rose 2.4 percent to C$2.10 in early trading.The move is part of a larger trend that has seen small firms rebrand or reorient their businesses toward cryptocurrencies, marijuana or fintech in an effort to cash in on the torrid investor love affair with the new businesses. Microcaps previously involved in sports bras, fruit juices and teas have made the move and been rewarded with spikes in their share prices.While Glance combines all three, it's not the first time cannabis and crypto have crossed paths. Marijuana growers and sellers in states that have legalized pot still can't access traditional financial institutions because the plant remains a banned substance by the U.S. federal government, forcing merchants to deal exclusively in cash. That logistical headache and constant security threat has forced many to turn to bitcoin.The legalized pot industry was dealt a blow Thursday after a report that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will rescind policies allowing for the expansion of legal marijuana without federal intervention.For more on cryptocurrencies, check out the Decrypted podcast:??

That's what the jury's going to have to decide,???U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco told prospective jurors at the start of the selection process Wednesday.

The companies are part of a fierce race to market driverless technology, estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year in revenue.Opening arguments begin Monday, and the trial is expected to be thick with allegations of backstabbing plots, greed and grudges. Witnesses will include Travis Kalanick, the voluble co-founder of Uber who was forced out as its chief executive officer in June, and Alphabet's reclusive chief, Larry Page, who rarely speaks publicly.Anthony Levandowski, the engineer accused of spiriting thousands of proprietary files from Waymo to Uber, also will be called to testify, even though he has remained mostly silent since the case was filed. If he chooses to stay quiet, Levandowski will be required to assert his constitutional right against self-incrimination in front of the jury as Waymo lawyers barrage him with questions.Waymo and Uber Head for a Self-Driving Car Crash in CourtJurors will hear about a heap of circumstantial evidence that Levandowski colluded with Kalanick even before he left his job at Waymo. The Alphabet unit also says it has technological evidence that Uber stole secrets to copy its LiDAR, the reflection of laser beams self-driving cars rely on to sense surroundings and avoid pedestrians, obstacles and other vehicles.??This is not a case where a group of engineers had an accidental foot-fault and crossed the line from know-how to trade secret because they didn't know where the line was,?? said Amy Candido, a lawyer for Waymo with Quinn Emanuel. ??This is a case where Levandowski and other individuals at Uber intentionally, brazenly and willfully together misappropriated Waymo's trade secrets. It was not an accidental case of stepping over the line.??Silence from Levandowski as a central figure in the trial ??leaves open loose threads on all sides,"" and that invites speculation by the judge and jury, said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University's law school. Levandowski's refusal to answer questions could make it harder for Waymo to prove its case, and it could also complicate Uber's effort to argue that it didn't benefit from his actions, Goldman said.It works in Uber's favor that California, where both companies are based, has a well-established public policy of protecting, even encouraging, employee job-hopping.??The law goes out of its way to protect employee mobility because it is essential to innovation, to a dynamic economy, and to free choice to work where you want,"" Uber said in a statement.In the end, it may come down to whether the jury is convinced that information claimed as trade secrets actually qualifies for legal protection, the professor said.??The judge really wants to make sure general knowledge isn't converted into trade secrets, and bars employees from taking new jobs,"" he said.For more on self driving vehicles, check out the Decrypted podcast:The case is Waymo LLC v.

Why Uber Needs to Take the High Road to an IPO,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/why-uber-needs-to-take-the-high-road-to-an-ipo-quicktake-q-a,"January 16, 2018, 12:01 AM EST",quicktake,,"Back in 2015, explaining why Uber Technologies Inc. was years away from a public offering, co-founder Travis Kalanick likened the company to an eighth grader too young to go to the high school prom. Since then, the ride-hailing giant has been besieged: allegations of sexual harassment, a lawsuit (now settled) alleging theft of trade secrets, a miscellaneous morass of malfeasance that spawned multiple criminal investigations, and the ouster of Kalanick as chief executive officer, followed by a lawsuit to keep him from taking control of the board. The newly appointed CEO announced he's aiming for an initial public offering by 2019. Will Uber be cleaned up by then?By one measure, they've collectively knocked off almost a third of the $69 billion valuation that made Uber the most valuable unicorn on the planet.?Meanwhile, the firm that dominates ride hailing in China, Didi Chuxing, gained a valuation of $56 billion in December and positioned itself to better compete with Uber in other parts of the world. Uber's tattered reputation has also been a boon to Lyft Inc., its closest rival in the U.S. Lyft gained significant market share in 2017 as Uber suffered from executive turnover and self-inflicted wounds, including a protest over the company's ties to the Trump administration.Yes. The company hasn't been charged, but it was said to be facing at least five separate investigations by the U.S. Justice Department as of October. All that's known about these probes is their subject matter: misappropriation of intellectual property, violations of?price-transparency and overseas bribery laws and the use of software programs for spying on rival companies and deceiving regulators. Under a 1909 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed prosecutions of corporate entities when acts and intentions of the company's employees can be attributed to the company itself.?Large companies are rarely targeted with criminal charges. Federal authorities haven't disclosed how far along they are in the Uber investigations, and it remains to be seen whether the ultimate target is the company or individual executives. If the company were to be indicted for any crime, it?would face immense pressure to try to work out a deal -- either by pleading guilty or persuading the government to defer prosecution as long as Uber stays out of trouble -- rather than take the risk of fighting the charges at trial.Corporations convicted of crimes don't go to jail like people do. Instead, they are typically fined and sometimes put on probation for several years. For Uber, that would mean court-ordered oversight of its operations -- not an uplifting prospect for investors.Plenty. Here are just two areas of vulnerability:Introducing himself to Uber's staff in August 2017,?new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said an IPO would probably happen within 18 to 36 months. It's hard to prepare for an IPO without a chief financial officer -- and Khosrowshahi hasn't hired one yet. The big challenge facing Uber is to stop losing so much money; its losses have continued to widen even as its revenue and bookings have grown. Resolving outstanding legal disputes should also be on the to-do list. It's reasonable for investors to wonder whether the high frequency in recent years of fines, lawsuit settlements and writedowns is an unusual or a perpetual feature of Uber's business model.Fairly or not, much of the blame is directed at Kalanick, whose view of the law as something to be tested is well-chronicled. He defined Uber's culture by hiring deputies who were, in many instances, either willing to push legal boundaries or look the other way. A broader view is that, for all its celebrated disruptive technology, Uber operates based on a fundamental illegality: It built a worldwide transport business using unlicensed vehicles.

The new boss has spearheaded an apology campaign to quell regulatory disputes in Norway, Britain and Brazil, hired a former high-ranking Justice Department official as his chief legal officer and tweeted about directing his staff to stop using encrypted and ephemeral communication methods. In settling Waymo's complaint that Uber stole its technology for driverless cars, Khosrowshahi expressed regret over the ordeal.

Alibaba to Invest $200 Million In India Online Grocer,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-08/alibaba-is-said-to-invest-200-million-in-india-online-grocer,"December 8, 2017, 4:47 AM EST",technology,,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., China's e-commerce giant, plans to invest about $200 million in?India's largest online supermarket, Bigbasket, leading a $280 million funding round in the startup, according to people familiar with the negotiations.Alibaba is taking a stake of about 25 percent in Bigbasket?after months of negotiations, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. The Bangalore-based grocery business had previously been in talks for an investment from e-commerce pioneer Amazon.com Inc., which in June agreed to acquire U.S. grocer Whole Foods Markets Inc.The investment marks an escalation in the competition between the world's two largest e-commerce companies in India, one of the world's fastest-growing -- and as yet unconquered -- online retail markets. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has vowed to invest $5 billion in the country as he challenges local leader Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Alibaba has invested in One97 Communications Ltd., which runs digital payment and e-commerce businesses.The Bigbasket deal is awaiting approval from the country's antitrust authority, the Competition Commission of India, the people said. That is now seen as a formality and should come through any day, one person said.Bigbasket and Alibaba did not respond to emails seeking comment on the new funding.The deal values Bigbasket, a purveyor of groceries and household needs like toothpaste and freshly-ground masala (spice) powders, at $800 million.?An affiliate of One97's Paytm E-commerce Pvt may join Alibaba in its $200 million stake with a small investment, the person said.Grocery and daily essentials is a challenging business the world over, even in advanced markets like the U.S. and China. Bigbasket, owned by Innovative Retail Concepts Pvt, operates in a country where expansion is difficult beyond the biggest cities because of rudimentary logistics and a shortage of refrigerated trucks and warehouses.Growth will require capital expenditures, and Amazon got government approval earlier this year to invest $500 million into food retailing. Several high-profile grocery startups have collapsed in the last couple of years in India.At the same time, online retailers can build loyalty and push high-margin private labels and fresh produce to buyers in the e-commerce segment that sees the highest repeatability.Bigbasket's TV commercials feature Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan shopping for his home and then endorsing in Hindi ??Main ek Bigbasket-eer hoon, aur aap??? (I'm a Bigbasket-eer, and you?). The company now delivers in over two dozen Indian cities and offers 18,000 products from over 1,000 brands.

Murdoch Solves Empire Succession by Getting Rid of the Empire,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/murdoch-solves-empire-succession-by-getting-rid-of-the-empire,"December 15, 2017, 2:44 AM EST",deals,"""Fox sale to Disney a nod to need for massive scale in media"", ""James in line for Disney role, Lachlan to run remnants""","For decades, investors, analysts, busybodies, columnists and gossips have loved to chew over the ultimate media-dynasty question: When Rupert Murdoch was at long last forced to step down -- whether for age, coup or scandal -- which of his children would assume the throne of his vast empire? James or Lachlan or Elisabeth? Now we know the answer.There will be no vast Murdoch empire to inherit. There will be no throne.Rupert MurdochOn Thursday, Walt Disney Co. announced it has agreed to pay $52.4 billion to acquire much of the sweeping territory Murdoch spent a lifetime assembling. Among other assets, Disney will take control of 21st Century Fox Inc.'s TV and movies studios, its slate of cable TV networks, including FX and National Geographic, its stakes in the satellite-TV networks Sky and Star India, and its 22 regional sports networks. It may even get one of Murdoch's children in the bargain: James is expected to help Disney with the integration process and may stick around to play a larger role.Not that Murdoch is out of the picture entirely. He'll still rule over a major broadcast network, a cable sports channel and Fox News.?In an interview with Sky News, Murdoch said he will remain executive chairman, likely with his eldest son Lachlan as chief executive officer. And the Murdochs will hold a stake of more than 4 percent in Disney, ranking them among the largest shareholders. But that's hardly an empire. In a world increasingly dominated by global tech giants, it's more like a province. Maybe an enclave.Perhaps, as some have speculated, the new Fox will reclaim the newspaper and publishing assets Murdoch spun off in 2013 into a separate company, News Corp. But even if that happens, the resulting company will be minuscule in comparison with the sweeping realms of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple, all of whom who are jockeying to control the future of media, news, information and entertainment.Elisabeth Murdoch??The Murdochs spent all year talking about how they had scale,?? says David Folkenflik, the author of ??Murdoch's World: The last of the old media empires.?? ??And then suddenly they were like, we have to sell to someone else so they can get bigger, so they can fight the giants. It's too much for us.??In the wake of the Disney deal, questions about family-power dynamics will surely persist. But the stakes will be dramatically lower. There is no longer a pressing need to find some brilliant global visionary to replace the patriarch and deftly navigate the complex, multi-variable calculus of the emergent global-streaming sphere. For Fox, the challenges and opportunities will be much smaller, much less daunting.Murdoch, for one, says the sale to Disney is not a retreat. It's a pivot. ??With today's announcement, we launch the next great leg of our journey,?? he said on a call with investors Thursday. ??The world of media has obviously been undergoing rapid change. New technologies, competitors and shifting consumer preferences have redrawn the whole media map.??And diminished Murdoch's place on it.It's to Murdoch's credit that he recognized sooner than most of his peers the existential threat Alphabet Inc.'s Google and its ilk posed to the expansive media empires of the last century. These days, you can't go five minutes at a future-of-media conference without everyone fretting about the so-called online advertising ??duopoly??: Google and Facebook Inc. will rake in 63.1 percent of all digital-advertising spending in the U.S. this year, according to eMarketer. For everybody else, that leaves just crumbs.Murdoch, for one, is cashing in his chips. Along the way, he is doing the kind of empire estate-planning his onetime rival, media mogul Sumner Redstone, long neglected. That inadvertently touched off one of the most tangled and bitter succession battles ever.James MurdochBy trimming his empire now, Murdoch may be saving his own heirs from a similarly bloody fate. Ultimately, it's a practical move, somewhat out of character for the serial acquirer.??This is the end of an era,?? says Tom Watson, deputy leader of the U.K.'s Labour Party, who played a key role in the campaign against phone hacking at Murdoch's newspapers in 2011. ??The Murdochs, after 30 years of aggressive empire expansion, are now in retreat.????

Tesla's Model 3 Challenges Leave Little ??Wiggle Room' on Cash,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-03/tesla-delays-model-production-goal-as-deliveries-miss-estimates,"January 3, 2018, 4:31 PM EST",climate-changed,"""Carmaker now sees making 5,000 units a week by end of June"", ""Delay raises prospect that another capital raise may be coming""","Tesla Inc. pushed back a key production target for its pivotal Model 3 sedan again, raising questions about whether the electric-car maker may need to raise more cash.The Elon Musk-led company now expects to assemble 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of June, delaying plans to reach that milestone by another three months. Tesla didn't come close to achieving an initial goal to manufacture that many of the sedans a week by the end of 2017.Tesla Model 3Tesla's slower ramp up in manufacturing Model 3s led analysts to speculate another capital raise could be coming. The carmaker has been blowing through more than $1 billion a quarter as it's had trouble scaling up output despite spending heavily on robots, assembly lines and tooling for the sedan that is Musk's cheapest yet, starting at $35,000.??Bears will point to this as another missed promise,?? Joe Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients Wednesday. While a capital raise may not be required, Tesla lacks ??a ton of wiggle room?? and should seek more cash to mitigate risks, he wrote.Tesla shares pared losses Thursday after falling as much as 3.6 percent, the biggest intraday drop in five weeks. The stock climbed 46 percent in 2017 and the company ended the year with a $52.3 billion market capitalization, placing it ahead of Ford Motor Co. and behind General Motors Co.??We believe a fundraise will be necessary for Tesla in 2018,?? Brian Johnson, an analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in a report to clients Thursday. He projects the company will burn through $4.2 billion this year and assumes the company will raise $2.5 billion in an equity offering, likely during the third quarter.Tesla reported deliveries of 1,550 Model 3s in the final three months of the year, trailing analysts' average estimate for about 2,900 units in a Bloomberg News survey.For more on Tesla, check out the Decrypted podcast:Tesla delivered 1,550 Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarterSource: Company statementsIncluding Model S sedans and Model X crossovers, Tesla delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles during the fourth quarter. The company delivered 101,312 Model S and Model X vehicles for the year, exceeding its forecast for 100,000 units. Sales of those more expensive models jumped 33 percent from 2016.In the months leading up to launching the Model 3, Tesla raised at least $1.2 billion through an offering of stock and convertible debt in March and another $1.8 billion by tapping the junk-bond market in August.Buyers of the latest bonds have since taken a hit, and it would likely cost Tesla more to borrow in that market again. The 5.3 percent notes were yielding 6.09 percent on Thursday after the price of the debt dropped.Tesla still has options for financing given its equity?market capitalization, said John McClain, a money manager at Diamond Hill Investment Group. The company could probably also issue unsecured, convertible or secured bonds since the market in general is so strong, he said.??It would be concerning to me if I were an existing lender that they pushed back production goals and it continues to be a show-me kind of story,?? he said. ??But I would not question?their ability to finance at this point.??Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo said he sees Tesla having enough cash and additional liquidity sources to get through the revised 5,000-a-week schedule, meaning no capital raise will be required in the first half of this year.??We think there is even room to hold off returning to the capital markets if the new schedule goes slightly slower than expected,?? he said in an email. ??That said, this continues to be a major focus by the market.??In a statement Wednesday, Tesla thanked customers ??who continue to stick by us while patiently waiting for their cars.?? The company announced the acquisition of Perbix, a closely held maker of automated machines used for manufacturing, back in November, a week after Musk cited challenges with automating Model 3 production.??Tesla has really lofty goals for automation,?? Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Investment Management, which holds Tesla shares, said in a phone interview. ??One you have it right you can ramp really quickly, but getting to that phase is the difficult part.??Tesla ended September with about $3.5 billion cash in hand and projected another $1 billion in capital expenditures during the last three months of the year. By postponing production plans, the company may also be deferring spending, said Jeff Osborne, an analyst at Cowen & Co. who has the equivalent of a sell rating on the shares.The company may need to raise another $1 billion to $1.5 billion over the next six months, Osborne said Thursday on Bloomberg Television.Read more: GM's Chevy Bolt chases Tesla, doubles Nissan Leaf salesTesla reported 860 Model 3 sedans were in transit to customers at the end of December.

The FCC said some of the nearly 23 million comments on Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to gut Obama-era rules were filed under the same name more than 90 times each.New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, as well as lawmakers and other state officials, had asked the commission to delay its vote and implementation of new policy on the basis that the fake comments had impacted the agency's ability to assess public reaction. The agency declined to do so.The Latest: What Happens When States Have Their Own Net Neutrality Rules?The FCC on a party-line 3-2 vote in December swept aside rules barring broadband providers from favoring the internet traffic of websites willing to pay for speedier service. That move sent the future of net neutrality on to a likely court challenge.Lawsuits challenging the order are likely to be filed as soon as Jan. 16, though earlier key court rulings could make it hard to win such suits, said Matthew Schettenhelm, a government litigation analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.The Internet Association, whose members include Google, Netflix, Facebook Inc. and EBay Inc., said it will join any lawsuit against the agency. In addition, it said, its members ??will continue our push to restore strong, enforceable net neutrality protections through a legislative solution.??The group said in a statement that ??this rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet.??The Republican-led commission voted to remove Obama-era prohibitions on blocking web traffic, slowing it, or demanding payment for faster passage via their networks. Over objections from its Democratic members, the FCC gave up most of its authority over broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp., handing enforcement to other agencies.Pai and his two fellow Republican commissioners said in comments accompanying the order that it's a way to ??restore internet freedom?? and called the earlier FCC rule a ??mistake?? that led to less investment, particularly by smaller internet service providers.??For one thing, there was no problem to solve,?? Pai wrote. ??The internet wasn't broken in 2015. We weren't living in a digital dystopia. To the contrary, the internet is perhaps the one thing in American society we can all agree has been a stunning success.??Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the rule gives extraordinary powers to broadband providers who can't be trusted to keep promises that they won't undermine certain businesses or discriminate against sites.??They will have the power to block websites, throttle services, and censor online content,?? she said in a statement. ??They will have the right to discriminate and favor the internet traffic of those companies with whom they have pay-for-play arrangements and the right to consign all others to a slow and bumpy road.??New York and California are considering their own rules, but the FCC order specifically says that it would preempt any state or local measures ??that interfere with the federal deregulatory policy restored in this order.??The FCC's new policy takes effect upon approval of the rule by the Office of Management and Budget, the agency said in a news release.

Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said Thursday in a statement.?The bank is one of a handful that have cleared the trades since the Cboe began offering futures contracts earlier this week. Bitcoin's volatility spurred many large banks to hold off on clearing trades.

The law has garnered early potency, after Twitter moved quickly to block posts from two senior politicians?for the Alternative for Germany, a far-right opposition party.The law is the result of a conflict that has been simmering since 2015, when Merkel confronted Facebook's Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg on how his company is progressing in efforts to curtail racist posts during the country's refugee crisis. Also frustrated by a surge in hate speech and fake news during Germany's 2017 election campaign, Merkel's government drafted the law that was approved by lawmakers last summer -- despite criticism from the companies as well as internet activists, who are saying it's curtailing free speech.The so-called Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz law is demanding that social networks with more than 2 million users -- everyone from Facebook to Pinterest Inc. -- remove illegal content within 24 hours once it's flagged (or seven days if the case is more complex) or face fines of up to 50 million euros. The likes of Facebook are also to?implement functions that allow users to more easily flag potentially illegal posts, and produce a yearly report detailing what it deleted and why.An unusual alliance of critics has spoken out against the law -- from the social networks to the OSCE to the far-right Alternative for Germany party, who are all complaining that it reduces the diversity of opinions. The editor-in-chief of Bild, Germany's biggest-selling daily, said in a Jan. 4 editorial the law is a ""sin against freedom of speech,"" and should be abolished because it puts the decision over what's illegal and what isn't in the hands of companies instead of the courts.Facebook, Google and Twitter have already implemented measures allowing users to more easily report contested content. Even before the law was enforced Facebook had hired 1,200 people to screen its site for illegal postings and had removed tens of thousands of fake accounts in Germany in the month before the election. Twitter and Facebook in the first days of this year already deleted content and temporarily blocked accounts -- from seemingly racist comments by AfD lawmakers to tongue-in-cheek posts by the satire magazine Titanic, showing that the system still needs fine-tuning."

But the chairman of an important committee in Parliament begs to differ and is escalating the fight in the U.K.Damian Collins, a member of Parliament who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, attacked the social media giant for failing to address his questions about possible Russian interference in the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union and the June election.In a letter to the committee released Wednesday, Facebook said the Internet Research Agency -- an entity that U.S. intelligence agencies have identified as part of a Russian-led effort to sway the U.S. presidential election -- only spent 97 cents on ads targeting U.K. audiences in the lead-up to the referendum. The money purchased three ads that were seen by about 200 people over four days in May 2016, according to the letter.Collins hit back: ??No work has been done by Facebook to look for other fake accounts and pages that could be linked to Russian-backed agencies and which were active during the EU referendum, as I requested,"" he said. The company, he said, had failed to answer the questions he put to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg in an Oct. 19 letter.Facebook had this to say in response: ??We strongly support the Commission's efforts to regulate and enforce political campaign finance rules in the United Kingdom, and we take the Commission's request very seriously.??Last year, Facebook said it wasn't finding any Russian disinformation activity around the U.S. election, at first. The company was able to accelerate its search through the trillions of interactions on its site only after the U.S. government put out a public report explaining that the IRA was a firm on authorities' radar. Facebook eventually estimated that about 150 million people in the U.S. saw IRA content on Facebook and Instagram before and after the election.Facebook hasn't seen a similar report from U.K. intelligence. The company has been working to hire people with security clearance so it becomes easier to have conversations with governments about where to look for bad actors.Collins's remarks come at a time when biggest U.S. internet companies are under mounting political pressure in the U.K., with Prime Minister Theresa May repeatedly calling on tech companies to do more to combat extremist content on their sites. An influential watchdog panel recommended that Facebook and other social media platforms be regulated as publishers to prevent politicians from being subjected to abusive content and messages during campaigns.Collins, a 43-year-old Conservative lawmaker, said that the company had done a more thorough investigation of tens of thousands of fake pages and accounts that were active during last spring's French presidential election.???They should do the same looking back at the EU referendum and not just rely on external sources referring evidence of suspicious activity back to them,?? he said.?He said it was not credible that Russian entities only used Twitter to try to influence British voters during the EU referendum, when both Twitter and Facebook were used during the U.S. presidential election.

Not every company spends as much on protecting their computers from hackers. Yapian, the owner of bitcoin exchange Youbit, said in December it would close after getting breached.Like bitcoin, Monero uses a network of miners to verify its trades. But it mixes multiple transactions to make it harder to trace the origin of funds, and adopts ??dual-key stealth?? addresses that make it difficult to pinpoint recipients.South Korean investigators are looking at North Korea among their suspects. The country's hackers are increasing attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges in Seoul, security researcher FireEye Inc. said in September.?The U.S. has also blamed North Korea recently for the WannaCry ransomware attack that affected hundreds of thousands of computers globally in 2017. Hackers demanded bitcoin in exchange for unlocking the files they had coded with malware. North Korea denies any role in cyber crimes.The majority of attacks from North Korean hackers in the past year have focused on financial gain rather than government secrets, according to researchers dealing with them.?The shift of focus may accelerate this year as the UN is stepping up its efforts to cut the flow of funds used by the regime to fuel its nuclear arms development.Read more about North Korean attacks on bitcoin exchanges??North Korean threats meant attacks on the government and national defense, but now they are looming very large over the private sector,??

That compares with the 20,000 tons-a-year guidance Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg gave in August and could give Glencore control of about 40 percent of world supplies, according to current data.Glencore, which mines products from coal to zinc and trades some 100 raw materials, is zeroing in on cobalt after prices more than doubled this year on demand from automobile and battery manufacturers.The trader has already held discussions with?Volkswagen AG, Tesla Inc., Apple Inc. and various battery makers about signing supply contracts, Glasenberg said Tuesday. ??There's a lot customers who want to lock in supply,?? he said on an investor call.The company's Mutanda Mining, also in the Congo, was the largest producer of the metal last year, shipping 24,500 tons out of a worldwide market of about 109,500 tons, according to cobalt trader Darton Commodities Ltd. The boost in output at Katanga will make the mine comfortably the world's biggest. It will ship 11,000 tons next year, according to Monday's statement, and should add $800 million to Glencore's mining revenue, based on Bloomberg calculations at current spot prices.Congo, source of 60 percent of world cobalt supply, aims to take a larger share of earnings from the metal by increasing taxes. Lawmakers in the central African country last week approved new mining legislation that would increase royalties to 3.5 percent from 2 percent and introduce a profit windfall tax.Glencore and other miners have opposed the changes, which they say will drive away investment. The new code won't affect current operations as the existing legislation protects contractual terms for at least 10 years from the date of any change, the companies said Dec. 11 in a joint statement.Still, even with increased supply from Glencore's mines, there will not be enough cobalt to deliver the number of electric vehicles needed and new battery technology using less or no cobalt will be required, Glasenberg said.Glencore estimates that at least 314,000 tons of additional cobalt production would be required to make 30 percent of new vehicles electric by 2030.??The world will have to find a better solution,?? he said.Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is a senior independent non-executive director at Glencore."

The?Suwon, South Korea-based company took the opportunity to unveil a 50-to-1 stock split, which sent its shares surging.The earnings report for the last three months of 2017 draws the curtain on an eventful year, during which heir apparent Jay Y. Lee was jailed for corruption in connection with a national influence-peddling scandal. Even so, South Korea's most prominent company continues to churn out profits, as demand for memory chips, displays and semiconductors help to make up for less money earned abroad due to the country's rising currency. With the stock split, individual investors will find it easier to buy Samsung shares, according to Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co.??There've been calls for a stock split in the market to increase liquidity and Samsung's embracing them now,?? Roh said.Samsung shares jumped as much as 8.7 percent after the board approved the share plan and a report showed that net income rose to a record 12 trillion won ($11.2 billion) in the three months ended December. Samsung is already the country's biggest stock, accounting for one-fifth of its main stock exchange. The shares closed little changed at 2,495,000 won on Wednesday.Still, attention next week will turn to Lee, who denies any wrongdoing and will receive a ruling on his appeal of a five-year sentence.??Regardless of where Jay Y. Lee is, the top priority for Samsung is keep up profit in the face of uncertainties from the strengthening won to the growing specter of protectionism,??

The stock reached record highs last year before sliding on concerns of slowing demand for memory chips, the largest source of income for the company that also supplies organic light-emitting diode screens for Apple Inc.'s most expensive phone.Operating profit for the quarter was 15.15 trillion won on sales of 66 trillion won, Samsung said, confirming preliminary numbers released earlier this month. The Suwon, South Korea-based company said a higher Korean currency reduced profit by 660 billion won, and that it anticipates a ??negative impact?? from the fluctuations in the won and lower seasonal demand in the first three months of the year.For more on Samsung's cash and profitability, click hereOperating profit from the chip division more than doubled from a year earlier to 10.9 trillion won.

Settling transactions in the yuan gives Canadian companies broader access to suppliers and customers in China, where many smaller firms only use yuan. It?also helps firms in both countries avoid costly and time-consuming U.S. dollar intermediaries.Yuan flows between China and Canada are up 67 percent since the hub was established, and the currency now accounts for 15 percent of all flows between the two countries, compared with a 70 percent share for the Canadian dollar,?the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a?global payments network, reported in October.Still, just 7 percent of Canadian companies use the Chinese currency, compared with a global average of 24 percent, according to a separate?2016 study by HSBC Bank Canada.China has been boosting efforts to open its financial markets following the yuan's addition to the International Monetary Fund reserve currency basket. While the U.S. dollar is still the global currency of choice, the use of the Chinese currency has been on the rise.??There's no question that we're seeing an increased interest, in particular from onshore Chinese companies,?? said Scott Lampard,?managing director and head of global markets at HSBC Bank Canada. ??There's still some structural reforms or changes that the market would like to see that would bolster confidence in the currency as a reserve currency more from a store of value perspective.??In what may be a game changer for the hub, TMX Group Ltd., owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange, is working with Shanghai Clearing House to give Canadian investors access to China's fledgling corporate bond market.Once established, the link will allow for clearing and settling transactions from Toronto, with the project likely to see the first flows in 2018,?says Glenn Goucher, president of?TMX's Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation.??You're not just trying to shift flows, you're trying to increase the size of the pie,?? Goucher said. ??Our aspiration is to provide this service for the entire marketplace.??China's financial markets have already opened for some Canadian players. Bank of Montreal and HSBC's Canadian units were authorized by the People's Bank of China in November 2016 to become market makers for direct trading of yuan against Canadian dollars in China's inter-bank foreign exchange market.National Bank of Canada also issued its first panda bond, or yuan-denominated debt issued in China, in October 2016, and followed that up with another in September. British Columbia sold panda bonds last month, its fourth such transaction.Export Development Canada, a government agency supporting Canadian exporters, has issued dim sum bonds in China's offshore yuan market, though it still does most of its business in U.S. dollars, said Susan Love, EDC's deputy treasurer.??If we started to see the contracts or the loans that we are providing were in the yuan, then obviously there would be more demand for that kind of financing,?? she said. ??But we're not seeing that yet.??It's an education process that takes time, said Jennifer Reynolds, chief executive officer of the Toronto Financial Services Alliance, a lobby group that played a key role in setting up the hub. ??We certainly would like to see greater adoption, but it's early days,???she said."

On Tuesday, Samsung reported 2017 chip sales of $69 billion, blowing past Intel's $63 billion from last year.The switch underlines how Samsung has transformed itself from a maker of cheap televisions into a pervasive supplier of key components in smartphones and other modern computing devices. It's also a testament to the growth of memory chips, Samsung's main market.Intel, whose processors are the heart of about 90 percent of the world's computers, didn't have a bad year. Sales grew 6 percent. Success in computers is no longer enough, though. Memory chips, a market Intel only recently got back into, are now crucial parts of smartphones, which easily outsell PCs these days. Memory chips are also finding their way into a range of new devices such as cars.One of the ironies of Samsung's success in memory is that it's a business Intel created in the 1960s. The U.S. company exited the market when competition from Japanese companies became too great in the early 1990s, then recently re-entered. One of Intel's biggest growth areas last year was memory chips, but it has a long way to go to catch up with Samsung.The South Korean company got its start in memory chips by licensing technology from Intel's Japanese foes. Samsung is moving in on Intel's traditional turf now, making higher-priced components. Its factories now churn out processors that run mobile phones and it's the contract manufacturer for Qualcomm Inc., which is taking a run at Intel in PC and server processors."

Lee had one more meeting than previously disclosed with former President Park Geun-hye, a witness said, supporting an assertion by prosecutors that the billionaire heir sought to cover up bribery involving the world's biggest memory chipmaker.Park's former secretary Ahn Bong-geun, who took the stand Monday, said he showed Lee into the house within South Korea's presidential compound to meet with Park in 2014. Lee's lawyers have said that Park and Lee met only once, in the city of Daegu for five minutes in the same year.Ahn's testimony complicates Lee's appeal and efforts to clear his name. Lee was sentenced to five years in prison in August for bribing Park. Prosecutors argued that Lee sought the support of the national pension fund in order to complete a 2015 merger between two Samsung affiliates, which helped him secure more control over Samsung Electronics. Lee's lawyers have denied that the grandson of the company's founder engaged in any bribery, arguing the merger was aimed at boosting the group's competitiveness.South Korean Scandal May Force Change of Chaebol Ways: QuickTakeThe bribery allegations added fuel to an influence-peddling scandal that sparked nationwide protests and led to Park's ouster in March. The judge in the first trial ruled that Lee bribed Park's longtime confidante with horses in order to curry favor with Park.Park Geun-hyeIn a separate corruption case handled by prosecutors, Ahn was detained last month on charges of illegally taking funds from the national intelligence agency while Park was in power.Lee's appeal hearings are set to be wrapped up by the end of this year, with a ruling expected in January.Samsung has achieved record operating profit on soaring semiconductor prices this year despite Lee's absence.

Iron Ore From Paradise Wins No Takers as China Upends Market,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-08/iron-s-flight-to-quality-kills-trade-from-india-s-beach-paradise,"December 7, 2017, 10:02 PM EST",technology,"""‘There's absolutely no market,' Goan industry group reports"", ""China's green push hurts demand as mills shun lower grade ores""","A China-led flight to quality in the global iron ore market is punishing producers of the lower-grade material, with miners in India facing an increasing battle to find buyers for their cargoes as demand dwindles.In Goa,?exporters are struggling to sell even a quarter of what they shipped last year, according to Glenn Kalavampara, secretary at the Goa Mineral Ore Exporters' Association. ??There's absolutely no market,?? he said by phone from Panaji, capital of the western state that's better known for its sparkling beach resorts. ??The preference for higher-grade ore is a major concern.?? he said.While Indian exports account for just a fraction of the global seaborne market of about 1.4 billion tons that's dominated by Vale SA, Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd., the plight of the low-grade shippers highlights the new dynamic. A concerted anti-pollution push in China this winter has supercharged the premium commanded by higher-grade material, which is more efficient. This week, Rio pointed to ??clear evidence?? of a structural change in the market, and earlier this year, BHP highlighted the industry's ??new reality??.??There are hardly any exports,?? R.K. Sharma, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, said by phone from New Delhi. Sharma has been working in the sector for almost five decades, and at one time saw Indian exports top 100 million tons. ??Even the Goans who are near the ports and have the least costs in the country are not able to sell,?? he said.China's push to clean the air has exploded the price differential between high and low grades. On Friday,?spot ore with 65 percent iron content from Brazil was at $87.20 a dry ton, while benchmark material of 62 percent was $69.35, and 58 percent was less than $40, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd.Goa shipped half of India's total exports of about 31 million tons in 2016-17, with a seasonal pattern to trade, as the retreat of the four-month monsoon around the end of September usually brings a revival in activity. That's not happened this year, and miners from the state, which include Vedanta Ltd., have shipped just 680,000 tons of lower-content ores in the two months since mining resumed, down 76 percent from a year ago, according to Kalavampara.That China's overall demand remains robust -- even as poorer grades get shut out and some mills are forced to trim production to ease pollution over winter -- was in focus on Friday. Data from Beijing showed year-to-date purchases near 1 billion tons over 11 months as imports snapped back in November.With the global market in flux, banks are factoring in lower shipments from India. Citigroup Inc. -- which is bullish on the outlook for prices in the first quarter -- expects exports will drop to 20 million tons next year from 28 million in 2017, according to its annual commodities outlook. After holding steady in 2019, the nation's flows may slump to 10 million tons in 2020.In India, exports of ore above 58 percent attract a duty of 30 percent, and miners have been seeking to have the levy scrapped to enable them to better compete with global players.???You know how aggressive Australia and Brazil are,???said Kalavampara. ??We have requested the central government to kindly consider scrapping tax for up to 60 percent to start with.??The difficulty in exporting lower-grade ore has led to a build-up of inventories at ports and mines. In October, Vedanta said it's sitting on stockpiles of about 4 million tons, according to R. Kishore Kumar, chief executive officer of the iron ore division. The company plans to raise the iron content in its ore to 58-to-59 percent from 54-to-57 percent."
Sweden Says #MeToo,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/sweden-says-metoo,"December 20, 2017, 4:00 AM EST",,"""In Scandinavia, harassment claims get a policy response.""","Sweden is one of the world's most gender-equal countries. It topped the European Union's gender-equality index in 2017 and ranked fifth on this year's Global Gender Gap Index from the World Economic Forum. When adjusted for differences in jobs, sectors, education, age, and working time, the wage gap is just 4.5 percent. This is largely the result of policies instituted since the 1970s designed to foster greater gender equality, which includes that fathers take at least 90 of the allotted 480 days' paid parental leave. That helps ensure dads share in child rearing and that moms stay in the workplace.And yet Sweden has been in the grip of its own #MeToo movement, raising questions about whether the nation's policies are actually creating a gender-equal society. Under the hashtag #silenceaction (a reference to what Swedish directors say before filming), hundreds of actors, including Oscar winner Alicia Vikander and Noomi Rapace, star of the Swedish version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, said they will no longer stay quiet. Similar campaigns have been undertaken by women in law (#withwhatright), music (#whenthemusicends), politics (#inthecorridorsofpower), the clergy (#lettherebelight), sports (#timeout), unions (#nonnegotiable), and even archaeology (#diggingisunderway), to name a few.Many in Sweden argue that it's the country's gender-equal policies that have enabled #MeToo to gain such traction there. ??Women in Sweden expect change,?? says Asa Regner, the country's minister for children, the elderly, and gender equality. ??They know that gender equality is possible, and they're aware of their rights.??While much of #MeToo in the U.S. and elsewhere has been about exposing powerful individual abusers, Swedish women have largely left both victims and aggressors anonymous. They've focused on creating culturewide change: Some 60,000 women in the country of 10 million people??almost 1 percent of the female population??have signed more than 25 #MeToo petitions, calling for measures such as longer statutes of limitations for sexual crimes, more and better education about equality, and a whistleblower system for people to report abuse anonymously.The same issues have been roiling the Swedish parliament, where there's been informal debate on increasing punishments for sex-based crimes and funding for organizations that help victims, as well as increasing focus on gender equality in school curriculum. A statement released on Dec. 15 by the government in response to the #MeToo movement described policy changes in motion, including a bill to alter the country's legal definition of rape, which applies only to sexual encounters that involve battery or threats of violence, to cover all forms of nonconsensual sex. By yearend, Sweden will have a national agency dedicated to gender issues to ensure that ??we get results from the decisions and money we invest,?? Regner says. Much of what's needed, she says, is greater enforcement of existing policies, especially within the corporate sector. Swedish law states that employers must actively promote equality between men and women in the workplace, including in corporate leadership, and take preventive action against harassment. An equality ombudsman resolves enforcement disputes. About half of Sweden's government ministers and more than 40 percent of its members of parliament are women. The government calls itself feminist and consciously applies the lens of gender equality to policymaking discussions.According to a survey conducted by market-research firm Novus for Sweden's public broadcaster, SVT, 70 percent of Swedes believe #MeToo will lead to change, including 72 percent of women and 67 percent of men polled. In another SVT survey, 22 of 28 employers with more than 10,000 workers and 9 of 10 trade unions said they thought the movement would have long-lasting consequences.With a general election in September 2018, the issue of gender equality is likely to remain high on the agenda, given the widespread impact it's having in Sweden. ??The revolution is happening at full force,?? former ABBA member Bjorn Ulvaeus wrote in a newspaper op-ed on Dec. 4. ??It's an unstoppable avalanche that will change society to its core. There is now no way back.?? ??With Anna Molin"

The Tokyo-based parent company declined to comment.The accords establish royalty rates between YouTube and rights holders for professional music videos and user-uploaded clips, and pave the way for YouTube to introduce a new paid music service early next year. Warner Music Group, the third major label, signed a new deal with YouTube in May.YouTube expects to convert some of the millions of people who listen to music for free on its video site into paying subscribers. That would help strengthen its relationship with the major label groups after years of tension over whether the Google-owned site was paying enough to copyright holders.?Universal, owned by Vivendi SA, got control for the first time over what appears on ad-supported channels and persuaded YouTube to improve scanning for user uploads that include copyrighted content, a person familiar with the matter said,?asking not to be identified discussing private information. Some songs and videos will only be available on the paid service, differentiating it from the free service, the person said.YouTube is one of the most common ways people all over the world consume music, and one of the most important promotional organs for managers and record labels. Yet the site and its parent company Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., have struggled to persuade consumers to pay for music.Paid services Spotify and Apple Music have spurred a recovery in the music business, converting people who listened for free or bought the occasional album into monthly subscribers. U.S. music industry sales grew 15 percent in the first half of 2017, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, while global sales grew 5.9 percent, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.Record labels have pilloried YouTube for a lax approach to copyright and insufficient compensation of artists, arguing sales would be growing more quickly if they generated more money from YouTube.Universal and Sony operate both recorded music and publishing divisions, and their label groups represent both in negotiations with YouTube.?It's unclear how long YouTube's new deals would last. Warner Music's agreement with the video site was shorter than normal to allow for flexibility in the future, according to a May memo from the label.YouTube and the record labels have had to overcome disagreements over the sharing of advertising revenue, the features and music available to free users and viewers outside the U.S. But YouTube is so popular that labels would rather work with the service than pull their music off.The major music groups can now turn their attention to Facebook Inc., owner of the world's largest social network.

H&M is attracting short selling, which peaked in the stock recently.A crisis that's shuttered shopping malls in the U.S. is spreading to other parts of the world, hitting H&M's earnings and forcing the retailer to cut prices to clear out inventory. Rival Inditex has been outpacing the Swedish company as it expands more aggressively in e-commerce. The Spanish giant this week reported a double-digit rebound in revenue growth for November and early December.H&M's Fast-Fashion Fail Is Actually a Problem for Zara: GadflyH&M reported ??quite possibly the worst quarterly sales performance on record,?? wrote Cedric Lecasble, an analyst at Raymond James.Sales excluding value-added tax fell 4 percent to 50.4 billion kronor ($6 billion) in the three months through November, the Stockholm-based fashion retailer said. Analysts expected revenue to increase 2 percent. H&M's sales have declined in only three quarters in the past 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Almost 15 percent of H&M's free float -- the shares that are readily available to trade -- has been shorted, according to Markit Securities data.?In a short sale, investors borrow shares and sell them in the hope that they decline, allowing them to repurchase them more cheaply and pocket the price difference as profit.Inditex CEO Pablo Isla said Wednesday that one of the key tenets of the Spanish company's strategy is its centralized inventory system, which allows it to decide which clothes to send out to each individual market at the last minute. H&M's logistics are slower, as the retailer depends more on shipping garments from Asia, which can take weeks or months.??H&M's supply chain lacks reactivity, which is one of the group's structural issues in front of abrupt changes in fashion,?? wrote Cedric Rossi, an analyst at Bryan Garnier. ?The company said Friday it aims to accelerate a transformation plan to better integrate physical and digital stores, and it will give more details on strategy changes at a Feb. 14 meeting with investors.

But its business is as safe as ever.That's the message from executives after an adjustment to the news feed algorithm -- the company's biggest moneymaker -- prompted investor concerns that user attention could drop off, curbing demand for advertising. Yes, the time spent on Facebook in the quarter declined by 5 percent, but it was by Facebook's design, executives said, in order to promote a higher quality experience. Yes, there was a dip in North American user numbers for the first time ever, but only because Facebook is already so dominant in the region.The company reported another record quarter of revenue, boosted by mobile advertising, and said they don't see the North American user decline as an ongoing trend. Executives also said Facebook advertisers have responded positively to the changes so far and predicted an increase in the number of ad impressions this year across the platform.Facebook's year was marred by challenges that led Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to rethink the company's main product, the news feed, to focus on ??meaningful?? social interaction. He said on Wednesday that changes in the fourth quarter cut the number of viral videos in people's feeds and reduced time spent on the service by roughly 50 million hours a day.??The most important driver of our business has never been time spent by itself, it's the quality of the conversations and connections,??

Qualcomm Gives Lackluster Forecast on Smartphone Slowdown,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/qualcomm-gives-lackluster-forecast-on-smartphone-slowdown,"January 31, 2018, 4:39 PM EST",technology,"""Company's sales and earnings projections missed estimates"", ""Samsung drops opposition to Qualcomm appeal in South Korea""","Qualcomm Inc. gave a disappointing revenue and profit forecast that confirmed industrywide concern the demand for smartphones is weakening.The company also announced an agreement with Samsung Electronics Co. it said will help resolve some of the challenges facing its technology licensing business, an area that hostile bidder Broadcom Ltd. has focused on in its appeal to Qualcomm's shareholders.Sales will be $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion?in the fiscal second quarter. Earnings per share, excluding some items, will be 65 cents to 75 cents, the San Diego-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts on average expected revenue of $5.6 billion and profit of 86 cents a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Qualcomm is seeing a build-up of inventory in phone parts in China and lower orders. The company also has experienced a steeper drop in orders for its modem-only products than normal for this time of year, said Chief Financial Officer George Davis. Apple Inc. is one of the biggest buyers of these products.The outlook shows the chipmaker is ??being hit with the same thing everyone else is being hit with,???referring to the waning smartphone demand. Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said. On the licensing side, the Samsung agreement demonstrates ??these things get settled,?? he added.For Qualcomm's management, the earnings report is one of the last chances to make the case to investors that the company should remain independent rather accept a $105 billion bid by Broadcom. Mollenkopf is appealing to shareholders who've suffered with a stock that has underperformed the market because of the struggling licensing business.The licensing unit has been hit with regulatory fines around the world and a challenge from Apple, one of its largest customers, which has stopped paying up as the two prepare to battle in the courts.??The big wild card is settling these licensing disputes and that's the hardest hurdle for investors,?? said Mike Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity.Licensing revenue declines from peak on nonpaymentsSource: Company dataProfit in the fiscal first quarter was 98 cents a share, excluding certain items. Revenue was little changed at $6.1 billion. Analysts had predicted adjusted earnings of 91 cents a share on revenue of $5.9 billion. The chipmaker said it had taken a $6 billion charge, including $5.3 billion related to a one-time repatriation of overseas cash, as a result of recent changes to U.S. tax law.The company's shares declined about 1 percent in extended trading after closing at $68.25 in New York. The stock fell 1.8 percent last year, making it the fourth-worst performer on the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index at a time the index jumped 38 percent.Qualcomm is unique in the semiconductor industry because it gets the majority of its profit from licensing technology. While chips that connect phones to networks and run programs on smartphones contribute the majority of its sales, patents on inventions that cover the fundamentals of all modern phone systems allow the company to collect highly profitable fees from phone makers.Sales in the company's chip business gained 13 percent to $4.65 billion in the fiscal first quarter. Licensing revenue dropped 28 percent to $1.3 billion.Regulators from South Korea, Taiwan, Europe and China have levied fines on Qualcomm, alleging it abused its dominant market position. The U.S. government is also investigating. Apple, which also accused Qualcomm of illegally leveraging its position in phone chips, has stopped paying licensing fees. That dispute alone is costing Qualcomm about $2 billion a year. Qualcomm has countered that all of this action is a coordinated attack based on false claims by Apple and that it will win in court eventually.The company's management may not have the time to play out their court strategy. After Qualcomm's board rejected Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan's Nov. 6 offer of $70 a share in cash and stock, Broadcom nominated board replacements, appealing directly to shareholders. That will be put to a vote March 6.The chipmaker announced Wednesday that Samsung has withdrawn its objection to Qualcomm's appeal of the fine in South Korea and had entered into a multiyear strategic relationship that will involve a variety of technological areas. Qualcomm said the agreement guarantees the world's largest phone maker will pay royalties, based on the price of each phone sold, until 2023. Qualcomm's patents enable it to get paid a percentage of the total sales price of a phone. Apple and others argue that cost places too much value on the chipmaker's inventions and the basis for those payments should be reduced to the price of Qualcomm's chips. Mollenkopf said his company is ??open to finding a path to resolution?? with Apple, but must do so in a way that doesn't give the iPhone maker an advantage over other phone makers. Qualcomm also is trying to close its $47 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV. The deal passed regulatory examination in Europe earlier this month, but is being held up by China. Meanwhile activist funds such as Elliott Management Corp. are arguing the offer undervalues NXP. Qualcomm had aimed to close the deal by the end of 2017."

Source: Earnest ResearchNote: Walmart purchased Jet.com in 2016The data show market share has changed little from a year ago even as more spending shifts online. That suggests brick-and-mortar stores are keeping their customers, even as more shoppers shift their spending to the stores' websites, said Andrew Robson, president and chief revenue officer at Earnest. Traditional retailers have been trying to match Amazon's strength by offering more products online and adding new services like letting shoppers find and purchase goods on the web and pick them up at nearby stores.??There's a stabilization and the traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are figuring out how to maintain share,?? Robson said.Wal-Mart traditionally sees a sales bump after Christmas due to clearance discounts, which could improve its final totals, he said.Earnest measures total spending for each retailer based on anonymous consumer transactions. The spending totals for Seattle-based Amazon measure gross merchandise value, or the price of all goods sold on the site. That figure is bigger than Amazon's total revenue because many of the products come from independent merchants and Amazon takes a commission on the sale. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, is also building its online marketplace model and measures sales by gross merchandise value.Earnest has launched a ??Consumer Insights & Competitor Intelligence?? tool that measures consumer preferences across multiple brands. A recent comparison of Wal-Mart and Amazon shoppers found that Amazon's customers prefer to buy clothing from Banana Republic, workout gear from Under Armour and fast food from Domino's Pizza while Wal-Mart shoppers prefer H&M clothing, Foot Locker athletic gear and Taco Bell."
Battery Makers' Great Hope for Cheap Lithium Faces Talent Crunch,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-28/battery-makers-great-hope-for-cheap-lithium-faces-talent-crunch,"December 27, 2017, 7:00 PM EST",hyperdrive,"""Shortage of Argentine engineers is holding back lithium growth"", ""SQM is sending skilled workers from Chile to its Argentine JV""","In the global rush to supply the electric-car revolution, lithium hot spot Argentina is grappling with a?shortage of talent.Battery makers are depending on the South American nation's high-altitude salt flats as a key new supply of the metal, with vast deposits and an investor-friendly government luring?prospectors and developers. Under President Mauricio Macri, Argentina has ambitions to become a lithium superpower, supplying as much as 45 percent of the market, up from about 16 percent now.Projects have faced unpredictable weather and financing struggles. But perhaps the biggest barrier to development is a dearth of skilled workers.??In Argentina, everyone wants to be a lawyer or a doctor,?? said Miguel Angel Persoglia, who has worked on copper and silver projects and now heads the pilot operations at Minera Exar SA, a joint venture between Lithium Americas Corp. and?Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA. ??There's no technical personnel?? for lithium.The shortage of local expertise can be seen as a growing pain in a new industry, and one that's being exacerbated by competition from other sectors, like shale gas, as?deregulation under Macri helps jump-start the economy.Argentina was the world&apos;s third-biggest producer in 2016Source: Argentine Energy & Mining MinistryUp until two years ago, the only company extracting lithium on a commercial scale from Argentine brine was U.S.-based FMC Corp., which began operations in the Dead Man salt flat in?1997. Australia's Orocobre Ltd. became the country's second?producer in 2015.The SQM-Lithium Americas venture on the?Cauchari-Olaroz salt flats about 13,000 feet (4,000 meters) above sea level in Jujuy province plans to start producing?lithium carbonate at an annual rate of 25,000 metric tons in 2019. Dozens of other projects are at earlier stages.Argentina is looking to take market share from neighboring Chile where would-be producers need authorization from the nuclear energy commission in a throwback to a 1979 decision to declare lithium ??strategic.??Extracting lithium from salty water is cheaper and easier than hard-rock mining. Producers drill for brine, then pump the liquid through giant hoses into turquoise evaporation ponds. What's left is processed into lithium carbonate, prices of which have tripled in the past three years.But companies including Orocobre have found the process is trickier than they first thought. The Brisbane, Australia-based company, which operates at?Cauchari-Olaroz in partnership with Toyota Tsusho Corp., has cited a lack of engineering expertise as contributing to its failure to hit a production target of more than 15,000 tons for the year through June. With cloudy weather also hindering evaporation and?snow storms stopping arrivals of a key imported chemical, output was about 11,900 tons.??You can't generate the know-how just like that,?? said Cristian Saavedra Lopez, a Chilean who heads Orocobre's lithium operations in Argentina. The company has been working for about two years with the National University of Jujuy to train both current employees and students who could apply for jobs at the mine, Saavedra Lopez said.The university, with the support of Conicet, Argentina's science and technology promotion agency, has set up a research center for improving extraction techniques and developing high-performance rechargeable batteries made with lithium. Notably, the center hired Victoria Flexer, a prominent Argentine chemist who was tempted home after years overseas.Argentina's lithium industry will employ 1,538 people by 2019, up from 1,178 currently, according to mining chamber Caem.A lithium carbonate mine with capacity of 20,000 tons a year needs an operational staff of about 200, according to Argentina's Energy and Mining Ministry. With 38 projects in the nation's lithium pipeline, including Minera Exar, that could mean an arduous headhunt to ensure 7,600 jobs of varying technical levels get filled.In the race to satisfy world lithium appetite that's set to more than double by 2025, driven by the electric-vehicle boom, Lithium Americas expedited the talent search.To equip?its Minera Exar venture with expertise, the company brought SQM on board in March 2016, giving up a 50 percent equity stake.?The partnership also ensured a $285 million investment from China's Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium Co. and Thailand's Bangchak Corp. at a time when it's proving tough to get financing for Argentine lithium projects.SQM already produces lithium carbonate at a much bigger mine on the Atacama salt flat over the border in Chile. It has sent 60 seasoned engineers to Minera Exar, according to Lithium Americas.??It's an arms race for engineers,?? said John Kanellitsas, Lithium Americas' president, comparing the talent squeeze to the shortage of specialist programmers in Silicon Valley. The problem,?according to Kanellitsas, is that generic mining experience is insufficient. ??This is not copper or gold,?? he said. ??Every lithium project is a bespoke chemical plant.??Argentina has the world&apos;s third-largest amount of recoverable lithiumSource: U.S. Geological SurveyFor companies further behind the curve, the answer has been to call on experience abroad.Advantage Lithium Corp., which is digging exploratory wells on the fringes of Minera Exar's holdings, lured Callum Grant out of retirement last year to lead operations, Chief Executive Officer David Sidoo said. Grant, a Scot, has worked in mining across the Americas for decades.Advantage plans to publish an estimate of its resource in the first quarter of 2018. Orocobre has a 25 percent stake in the project.Sidoo and his peers highlight the positives of operating in Argentina, like the asphalt road snaking up to the salt flats that makes transportation easy. But most of all, they say, there's the goodwill of the Macri government.?If the hurdles to assembling a talented workforce can also be overcome,??this is Argentina's time,??

As Tertill runs over smaller plants, sensors underneath activate a string trimmer.Jones, co-inventor of the Roomba, and MacKean, a mechanical engineer, met in 2010 while working at agricultural robot maker Harvest Automation Inc. They left in 2015 to start Franklin and develop Tertill.The team has raised about $450,000, mostly from crowdfunding, and is seeking additional investors.Jones and MacKean are focused on the home market for now, but they envision expanding into landscaping and farming with larger robots.Other, pricier robotic mowers cut down every plant within a preset path, making them unsuitable for gardens.Having completed working prototypes, Franklin plans to ship pre-orders in May and new orders later in 2018. John Santagate, research director at analyst IDC, says Tertill's utility and low price make it promising."
Facebook Is Counting on User Surveys for a ??Meaningful' Feed,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/facebook-is-counting-on-user-surveys-for-a-meaningful-feed,"January 31, 2018, 8:23 PM EST",technology,,"Facebook was designed to reward popular content, giving rise to damaging side effects like fake news and potential user depression. The company says it's going to fix that by prioritizing ""meaningful interactions"" instead. What does that even mean?Facebook doesn't know yet. It's going to use old-school surveys to find out, the company said on an earnings call with investors.Since 2014, Facebook Inc. has worked with a panel of thousands of users who go through their news feed and give feedback on the posts they see. The goal was to design the news feed so that information scrolled in the exact order people wanted. Now, the company will ask these users if their social interactions on the service are meaningful, instead of quizzing them on the quality of the content, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday.He's going to tell his product teams to design Facebook to inspire people to interact with one another. Think of the prompts users get to wish people a happy birthday, but a deeper social connection. If it works, Facebook shifts from an organizer of your social information to an instigator for your social activity -- a much more active role in the lives of its users.It's a challenging aim. And Facebook is pursuing it in the same way it's trying to solve the fake news problem -- through a simple survey asking people about trustworthiness (in the case of news) and the quality of interactions (in this latest effort). The approach has already sparked criticism: Doesn't the company realize that the wisdom-of-crowds technique is what created viral over-sharing?Zuckerberg defended the decision on Wednesday, saying ??people are smart, they know what they want and what's good.??The answers to these surveys will help Facebook decide what to tell all users. So when the social network sends people a stream of prompts to interact with friends, Facebook can say they asked for it."

DRIPA was repealed at the end of 2016 and replaced by the Investigatory Powers Act that critics have called ??the Snoopers' Charter.??The appeal court decision on a section of the 2014 act follows a ruling by the EU's top judges that said U.K. measures forcing telecommunications companies to keep customer data for a year violate the bloc's laws.The ruling means that ??significant parts?? of the U.K.'s Investigatory Powers Act ??must be urgently changed,?? Liberty, a human rights charity that backed Watson, said in an email.??This judgment tells ministers in crystal clear terms that they are breaching the public's human rights. The latest incarnation of the Snoopers' Charter, the Investigatory Powers Act, must be changed,?? said Martha Spurrier, Liberty's director, according to an email.The ruling doesn't change how law enforcement agencies can detect crimes because it relates to a policy that is no longer in force, Security Minister Ben Wallace said in a statement emailed by the Home Office.??We had already announced that we would be amending the Investigatory Powers Act to address the two areas in which the Court of Appeal has found against the previous data retention regime,?? he said. ??We welcome the fact that the Court of Appeal ruling does not undermine the regime and we will continue to defend these vital powers, which Parliament agreed were necessary in 2016, in ongoing litigation.??The opposition Liberal Democrat party said the government was ??tinkering around the edges?? of its surveillance laws. ??What we need is a full overhaul over the system that puts our freedoms and civil liberties at its very core,??

The government will consider the cumulative level of ownership in a sector, the need for diversity and the asset's critical importance.The sale of a stake in power network Ausgrid in late 2016 spurred consternation after the federal government barred New South Wales state from accepting an offer from State Grid Corp. of China, citing national security concerns. Ausgrid was subsequently sold to two local funds at a lower price. The new set of conditions ??avoids surprises?? for state governments and private sellers of power assets, Morrison said in the statement.??Clearly a consequence of this decision will be fewer buyers,?? Tony Wood, energy program director at the Grattan Institute, a Melbourne-based think tank, said in a phone interview. ??In the future, you won't get the price for power assets that you might have otherwise got.??Confusion over the ground rules for selling sensitive assets like electricity networks had damaged Australia's reputation among investors, according to Carbon and Energy Markets director Bruce Mountain. ??I think Ausgrid was poorly handled,?? said Mountain. ??The intervention by the Commonwealth government at the last minute to disallow certain bidders was not good from a buyers' point of view.??Australia also announced new rules on foreign investment in agricultural land, with Morrison saying such assets must first be advertised to Australian buyers.

"Tesla Is Selling Solar, Cars and Home Batteries, All Under One Roof",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/tesla-s-nyc-store-sells-solar-cars-and-home-batteries-under-one-roof,"December 14, 2017, 6:04 PM EST",climate-changed,,"If there's any doubt Tesla Inc. isn't just a car company anymore, its brand-new Manhattan showroom should put it to bed. On Friday, Tesla opens a store in New York's Meatpacking District that, for the first time, will sell cars, solar panels and batteries permanently under one roof.In a sparse, glass-walled space, the Model X sport utility vehicle and Model S sedan are on display alongside solar offerings and Powerwall storage systems. A?Model S sits?across from a sign that reads: ??Produce Your Own Clean Energy.???In this store and others that Tesla's enhancing across the U.S. starting Friday, car and energy salesmen will work side-by-side.Tesla's Chief Executive Officer?Elon Musk took a big gamble buying?SolarCity?Corp. last year. It opened up the billionaire to harsh criticism from some investors who described his takeover of the solar company??led at that time by his cousin, Lyndon Rive??as a bailout rife with conflicts of interest. The synergies of solar and electric vehicles weren't immediately clear, and Tesla has been working to integrate the businesses ever since, positioning itself as an energy??not strictly a car??company. This new New York store is the physical manifestation of that.Besides an occasional pop-up, solar was rarely before available in Tesla stores. Now, potential solar customers can discuss the power products with energy-focused salespeople in person??before or after checking out a new SUV. If they like the pitch, a site surveyor will then be sent to their homes to finalize the plan, followed by installation. Employing energy consultants directly in stores on a permanent basis lets the company cross-sell products and puts it on the offense at a time when residential solar is slumping in the U.S. after 16 straight years of growth.Although solar panels and the Powerwall home battery system are on display, noticeably missing from the expanded offerings in the 10,900-square-foot (1,013-square-meter) showroom is the Model 3, Tesla's more affordable and much-hyped electric sedan that began production in July. Output of the car, which starts at $35,000 before options, has been plagued by production bottlenecks, though the first non-employee customers just began getting their cars, suggesting progress on the production front.The long-anticipated Tesla solar roof is also not on display at the new Manhattan location, which replaces Tesla's smaller storefront in Chelsea. They're expected to be sold in stores in 2018 after testing is completed on those installed on employees' houses.Next year, Tesla customers will also be able to begin taking delivery of their electric cars at the Meatpacking location, rather than going to the Brooklyn store to pick up their new rides. The Manhattan store won't offer a service center like the Red Hook showroom near Brooklyn's industrial waterfront does??but it does have a free espresso bar for Tesla customers.The opening of the new Manhattan store coincides with an important company event: the completed integration of SolarCity?into Tesla. In the year since Tesla paid $2 billion to buy SolarCity, it's ditched its?door-to-door sales model, and next week, the integration is expected to be complete. With the exception of a website, the SolarCity name will mostly vanish, with all solar products instead sold under the Tesla brand.Though?the synergies of solar and electric vehicles weren't immediately obvious, the deal proved prescient: Other solar installers seeking to reduce high marketing costs amid market contraction have since sought partnerships with better-known brands. Tesla has also refocused the solar unit's strategy. SolarCity, which popularized the no-money-down lease, chased growth at all costs and amassed more than $3 billion in debt along the way. Tesla's energy unit has had success with solar-panel?sales and appears more focused on profitability.The new store may be in the heart of one of Manhattan's toniest sales corridors, but it's not intended just for downtown residents. The area draws tourists and commuters, and the store is situated beneath the heavily trafficked High Line elevated park.Expansive floor-to-ceiling glass faces out at The Standard hotel, allowing for sun to pour into the mostly white interior. The new store is on the same block as a Diane von Furstenberg showroom and is just a few blocks from an Apple Inc. store, which sports a similar clean, crisp design.The rented space includes several mounted touch-screens where buyers can configure their Model S and Model X vehicles, which are available for delivery to customers in the next month or two. Drivers can also put down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3, much like they do online. But with a wait list of some half a million customers, most buyers placing an order this week won't get their Model 3s until next Christmas??or later.For any holiday shoppers who can't wait a year or more for their Model 3s, solar panels??which could be installed within the month, permits and snowfall willing??may be the way to go. There's an energy consultant on-site."

"Bluebird, Celgene Myeloma Therapy Appears to Improve in Time",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/bluebird-celgene-myeloma-therapy-appears-to-improve-with-time,"December 10, 2017, 10:30 AM EST",technology,"""More than half of patients now have complete responses"", ""Even minimal residual disease not found in nine of 10 patients""","A novel therapy from Bluebird Bio Inc. and Celgene Corp. for patients nearing death from an aggressive form of blood cancer appears to get more effective over time, wiping out signs of disease in more than half of those treated in a small trial.A single infusion of the personalized therapy known as bb2121 generated a response in all but one of the 18 multiple myeloma patients treated at the highest dose,?according to the study presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in Atlanta.?After nine months, 56 percent were in remission. That's an improvement since May, when an earlier look at the data found 27 percent of the patients experienced a complete response.??Most of these patients were ready for hospice, and then this came along,?? said Jesus Berdeja, director of myeloma research at Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville,?and one of the first doctors to use the approach. ??These are just spectacular results in a patient population with a median expected survival of four months or less.??The treatment, known as a CAR-T, involves removing the patient's own immune system cells, tweaking them to attack the cancer, and infusing them back into the person. The first two CAR-Ts, from Novartis AG and Gilead Sciences Inc., were approved this year in the U.S. to treat certain forms of blood cancers. The Bluebird-Celgene therapy targets a different protein, BCMA, found on myeloma and plasma cells.In the bb2121 study, the improvements extended as long as 15 months for patients who had previously tried all existing therapies, including stem cell transplants, and seen their cancer return.Minimal residual disease, a measure of tiny levels of cancer cells found using the most sensitive laboratory tests, was present in only one of the 10 patients tested. The responses have persisted for more than a year in some patients, according to James Kochenderfer from the Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute,?the study's senior author.Longer study in more patients is needed before any conclusions about the therapy can be drawn, the researchers said. Not everyone improved, and among those who did the benefit wasn't always durable. After six months, 81 percent of patients hadn't had their cancer worsen, which fell to 71 percent after nine months, the study found.Out of an extended group of 21 patients, 15 developed cytokine release syndrome, a potentially deadly immune system response to the therapy, and five experienced neurotoxicty, including one 46-year-old woman who had a severe reaction.Bluebird, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Celgene, based in Summit, New Jersey, are starting to enroll patients in a larger study known as pivotal that is used to seek regulatory approval, with a goal of 94 patients. They will be followed for six months after the one-time infusion.It would be possible to fully enroll the study within a few months and have the therapy available in about a year, said Berdeja,?the director of myeloma research.There are about 30,000 new cases of multiple myeloma diagnosed each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. As many as 100,000 people may be living with refractory disease that hasn't responded to previous treatment, Berdeja said.Bluebird and Celgene aren't the only ones looking to treat multiple myeloma by targeting the BCMA protein.A rival CAR-T from Novartis and the University of Pennsylvania posted promising results at the hematology meeting, showing eight of 10 patients given a high dose responded, including one entering remission. A separate first-in-human study showed GlaxoSmithKline Plc's GSK2857916, a traditional biotechnology medicine that targets BCMA with an attached chemotherapy drug, generated a response in 21 of 35 patients.??All of these data indicate BCMA is an attractive target in refractory myeloma,?? said lead author Adam Cohen, director of Myeloma Immunotherapy at Penn's Abramson Cancer Center.For more on the meeting see NSE ASH17<GO>."

Previous entrants have spent time forging ties to London regulators before submitting transportation licenses.??We regularly talk to companies around the world about innovation that could improve transport in London,"" TfL's Hurwitz said in a statement.A spokeswoman from Lyft declined to comment. Ola didn't respond to a request for comment.Much of the perceived opportunity stems from Uber's recent conflicts with regulators. The European Union's top court in December ruled Uber must be regulated as a transportation service, a blow to the company's attempts to avoid taxi rules and licensing requirements. Uber is also appealing Transport for London's surprise decision in September to ban the app on safety and regulatory concerns. The court hearing is set for either April or June. Uber is hoping that it can settle its issues with TfL outside of court, a person familiar with the matter said.A spokesman from Uber declined to comment.?The recent ruling narrows the difference between companies such as Uber and Taxify -- which rely on connecting an ever-growing pool of self-employed drivers to pick up passengers -- and rivals such as Mytaxi and Gett, which allow users to hail local licensed black cabs.""All depends how the cases that are currently pending will deploy,"" said?Matteo de Renzi, CEO of Gett UK. ""In the short term it has been definitely an opportunity for the whole industry I think, a big wake-up call for the traveling public and corporates.""Taxify is concentrating on winning over drivers. ""This year our main value prop is the same -- treating drivers better,"" said Markus Villig, founder and CEO of Taxify, who cited a commission of 15 percent versus Uber's 25 percent. He added that the startup is targeting $1 billion in revenue in 2018.Other rivals are looking at M&A opportunities. A few days before Christmas, Daimler -- the German maker of Mercedes and Smart automobiles -- bought a majority stake in French private-hire limousine operator Chauffeur Prive. Daimler already owns Mytaxi and Car2Go, a car-sharing service that lets consumers pick up a car on the street.Despite Uber's latest setbacks, rivals still have some way to go to catch up. Gett operates in about 100 cities, including New York, London and Moscow. Taxify operates in 19 countries, while Mytaxi is active throughout Germany and the U.K.By comparison, Uber is active in various guises throughout almost all of Europe, and is the dominant player in both London and Paris. Taxify is still waiting for approval from TfL to operate in the U.K. capital after the regulator in October halted operations less than a week after they started."

That's about 400 fatalities a day and far higher than developed auto markets like the U.S., which in 2016 logged about 40,000.Now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is attempting to curb the carnage on Indian roads caused by everything from speeding two-wheelers to cars not equipped with air bags. A bill introduced in August 2016 -- proposing harsher penalties for traffic offenses and requiring that automakers add safety features -- has passed the lower house of parliament and is expected to go through the upper house in 2018.The scene of an accident on the Mumbai-Pune expressway in 2016 that claimed 17 lives and injured 28.The wide-ranging changes are likely to boost manufacturing costs for domestic and foreign carmakers in India. The South Asian country will be the world's third-largest car market after China and the U.S. by 2020, according to researcher IHS Automotive. The World Health Organization estimates that traffic crashes cost most countries about 3 percent of their gross domestic product.The U.K.-based non-profit?Global NCAP, which studies the quality of vehicles, has over the years assigned a?zero star rating to many small vehicles sold in India -- an assessment that there could be life threatening injuries in a crash at 40 miles per hour. Past efforts in India to boost road safety haven't taken off, and the success of this one will depend on how strictly it is implemented.India ""has delayed 20 years in making safety features mandatory,"" said Dinesh Mohan, a professor at Noida-based Shiv Nadar University. Globally, manufacturers haven't usually added such safety elements ""until and unless they were forced to do so by mandatory government regulations,"" he said.?A spokeswoman at?India's Ministry of Road Transport and Highways declined to give a timing for the new law.Indian consumers are famously price sensitive when it comes to car purchases. Low-cost and no-frills compact cars have long been sold by companies like Tata Motors Ltd., Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., a unit of Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp., Renault SA and Hyundai Motor Co. These budget vehicles are usually priced below 400,000 rupees ($6,300), and the new law is likely to require that their manufacturers add a string of features like?airbags, audio speed warnings and anti-lock braking systems.Costs for Indian automakers will shoot up by 7 or 8 percent after the passage of the new law and will be felt across the small car segment, said Deepesh Rathore, London-based director at consultancy Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors.Ashwin Patil, an analyst with brokerage LKP Shares and Securities Ltd., predicts a short-term impact to the earnings of automakers from the new act and said it could be a death knell for ultra-low-priced cars in India as their cost could go up by as much as 100,000 rupees.Manufacturers sometimes offer ""all safety features for the models that are sold in the international markets where they have to satisfy mandatory safety standards, while they offer minimum features for Indian models,"" said Mohan.The Renault KwidIn 2015, Renault sold its Kwid in India without a frontal airbag or anti-lock braking system, earning the model a zero rating from Global NCAP at the time. The following year, it got one star for??adult occupant protection after some safety features, including an airbag for the driver, were added. The brand in Latin America earned a higher three-star rating last year.Maruti Suzuki's popular Alto car?and the Tata Nano, which was launched as the world's cheapest car, are among those that have received a zero rating from the group. The Global NCAP tests are not mandatory for vehicles to be sold in India. All the models meet local safety standards, which are presently far more lenient than global ones. Tata Motors, Renault and Hyundai didn't respond to requests for comment.The Tata NanoCV Raman, head of research and development at Maruti Suzuki, said car makers are investing in facilities, testing and equipment to build advanced safety features into vehicles, ahead of the deadlines set by the government. For each model, Maruti has test crashed 35 to 40 cars to ensure they meet the advanced standards, he said.About 75 to 80 percent of Maruti Suzuki's cars will become compliant with Indian safety norms about a year before they are mandatory, the company said in a statement.Some companies like Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG haven't made a distinction between their Indian and export versions, and have already exceeded Indian safety norms. Rajan Wadhera, president at the automotive sector of India's Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., said his company offers the same safety features on both domestic and export models.In the Indian market, affordability and popularity have the greatest influence on car purchases, Wadhera said. ??Finally, it should be noted that it's the customer's choice that drives volumes than anything else.""The bill is expected to require the additional safety features on cars to be manufactured from July 1.?Indian road ministry data show that 83 percent of road accident fatalities were in the age group of 18 to 60 years, or mostly the working age population.  The new law will have higher penalties for offenses like drunken driving. Causes of the deaths on India's roads range from human error to potholed streets and manufacturing defects in vehicles. Speeding caused almost 67 percent of road accidents."

UC Berkeley?scientists also developed?seeds for?tomatoes resistant to bacterial spot disease, producing a plant that could combat a pock-marking?that leaves the fruit scarred and undesirable.?There's even a fast-germinating barley?that could save beer brewers?millions of dollars.Aside from their potential, each of these innovations has something else in common: They're all the result?of genetic modification. And that's where the problems start.???None of what we've done has made it anywhere,?? says Peggy Lemaux, a crop biotechnologist at Berkeley.From Lemaux's perspective, loud, anti-GMO?sentiment?from activists and consumer groups have kept investors away, even when there's a huge opportunity for benefits??and profit. That speedy barley, for example, was developed at the request of beer giant Coors Brewing Co. (now Molson Coors Brewing Co.) But?when?it was ready, Lemaux said, Coors?no longer wanted it. ??By the time we went back to them, they were like, ??oh no, we're not doing that.'??Molson?Coors said that while Coors funded research at Berkeley, it wasn't for???any of the findings to its barley breeding program.?? In a statement, the company emphasized, ??Molson Coors does not actively pursue GMO research, nor do we use genetically modified barley in our beers.??The campaign by consumer activists who questioned the health effects of GMO food, and the drumbeat of nations that imposed tough regulations and labeling rules, has had a marked effect. In some quarters, the GMO label has become radioactive. But with the effects of rapidly advancing climate change shifting how?and where the world gets its food, such people as?Lemaux?believe those who oppose genetic modification may want to reconsider.??The science is fully ready to go, but the opposition in some places is just a non-starter??In May 2016, a report on genetically engineered crops?sponsored by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, concluded there is ??reasonable evidence that animals were not harmed by eating food derived from [genetically engineered] crops.?? But public opinion has proven harder to sway. Some 39 percent?of Americans believe GMO foods are worse for you than non-GMO foods, according to a survey by?the Pew Research Center published in?December of last year.Those kinds of numbers?keep companies away?no matter how promising the technology. Proponents contend that corporate funding will be?vital to jump through the hoops regulators require?to sway regulators to approve such grains, not just in the U.S.?Without their imprimatur, these crops will never make it into the marketplace.???It's been quite a frustrating period to see things done in academics and get them put on a shelf,?? says Kent Bradford, director of the Seed Biotechnology Center and professor of plant sciences at the University of California at?Davis. ??The science is fully ready to go, but the opposition in some places is just a nonstarter.??To the frustration of scientists working on these technologies, the opposition often has more to do with unrelated wars over major GMO crops?than those actually being developed in university labs. Beyond consumer worries, opponents of GMOs often complain that?intellectual property rights and restrictive contracts held by big agriculture companies allow?them to exert too much control over the farmers who plant their products. While a reasonable complaint for commodity crops such as?corn and soy in America, it's?less applicable, scientists said, in the realm of?smaller crops.When GMOs?don't make their way onto the market, the?developing world is hurt the mostSarah Davidson Evanega, director of the Cornell Alliance for Science, works to enhance global food security. Her?organization tracks?biotechnology available in the public sector on its?Database of Emerging Agricultural Learning, which currently?lists 169 crops. The most common GMO crops in the U.S. are corn, soybeans, and cotton, but the alliance's database shows how wide-ranging genetic modification technology can actually be. For example, it lists drought tolerant rice in Colombia, high-protein sorghum in Kenya, and a pest resistant lemon in Mexico. The database lists the crops'?various stages of development??and how only 12 have been approved.?When GMOs?don't make their way onto the market, the people who get hurt the most are farmers and consumers in the developing world, she said. Like many pro-GMO advocates, she points to two popular?examples?with widespread, positive impact: disease-resistant?papayas introduced in?Hawaii in the 1990s, which essentially saved the crop from total decimation, and pest-resistant eggplant that allows Bangladeshi farmers to dramatically reduce or eliminate the use of costly, poisonous pesticides. The database, she said, represents more opportunities to replicate these kinds of successes.??The average cost to develop a single GMO is $136?million??GMO researchers argue that using science to modify?crops is a tool for handling the challenges of the modern world, such as producing more food in a harsher, less-predictable climate. Mankind, through greenhouse gases, changed the planet. Now?agriculture needs the help of science to thrive in a?volatile new environment.??Classical breeding just takes so long,?? said Lemaux. ??Plants aren't going to be able to keep up. The climate is changing too fast.???But Bill Freese, a science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety, disputes this. He said that sometimes conventional breeding actually produces better results and faster, pointing to drought-tolerant maize as an example.The problem with GMO research, Freese said, isn't just about the crops it creates; it's?also about the diversion of resources away from traditional breeding.??The average cost to develop a single GMO is $136?million,?? he said, citing a 2011 report done for Crop Life International. ??Conventional breeding,?? he said, pointing to another report about corn from 2002, ??is about $1 million.??Just as Evanega?points to papaya and eggplant to support her argument, Freese?raises the once-lauded Golden Rice to make his. The private sector-funded, genetically modified, high?beta-carotene grain was meant to help combat vitamin A deficiencies in children around the world.?Thus far, the crop has failed to live up to expectations?and there's?no shortage of critics?who assail its potential efficacy and the motives of the companies that developed it.??How many millions of dollars were invested in this boondoggle??? Freese asked.?The Golden Rice Project didn't respond to an inquiry about the cost of the initiative, but Freese points to a report from the Pesticide Action Network Asia & Pacific that estimates the cost at $100 million.?In some instances, the desired end can be achieved by either genetic modification or regular breeding, but the science that created it plays an outsize?role in determining which crop finds more success on the market.???You hate to think that it will take severe disasters to get people to accept these things, but sometimes?that's the case??Anyone who has ever bitten into an apple and then left it on the table for a few minutes knows what will happen: It will get brown. Unless, that is, it?doesn't. Thanks to both genetic modification and traditional breeding, such magic apples have existed for almost 20 years. But while the one created with traditional breeding, known as the Opal apple, reached the market in?2010, the GMO version, called the Arctic apple, just hit shelves last month.?This year, FirstFruits, the Opal apple's exclusive purveyor in North America, harvested 35 million pounds of its product. Compare that with apples from Okanagan Specialty Fruits, which developed the Arctic apple, and its 170,000 pound haul. (Both companies contend its apple is best.)Watch the Arctic Apple Not Turn BrownThe stakes might not seem so high to American consumers??a nonbrowning apple will probably cut down on wasted fruit but isn't going to fundamentally alter how people eat. But a high-protein potato in India or a drought-tolerant soybean in Argentina could have greater implications for populations in need.?Researchers worry that ignoring these advances, simply because?they carry the problematic GMO status,?could have terrible results.??You hate to think that it will take severe disasters to get people to accept these things,?? Bradford said, ??but sometimes?that's the case.??"

First Amazon Alexa-Enabled Digital Glasses to Debut at CES,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-05/first-amazon-alexa-enabled-digital-glasses-to-be-shown-at-ces,"January 5, 2018, 1:55 PM EST",technology,"""Vuzix, rather than Amazon, making augmented-reality device"", ""Amazon pushing its digital assistant to others' products""","The first augmented-reality glasses with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant will be shown next week at CES in Las Vegas -- manufactured by a 75-employee company rather than the e-commerce giant's growing devices division.Vuzix Corp. will show off a pair of smart glasses that can talk to Amazon.com Inc.'s voice-activated digital assistant and display information to the wearer's field of view, Vuzix Chief Executive Officer Paul Travers said in an interview. Vuzix's Alexa integration is part of an Amazon program that allows third-party hardware manufacturers to put the digital assistant into their products. In October, Sonos Inc. unveiled a smart speaker with Alexa's system for controlling music playback. The strategy is designed to put Amazon's service, which generates revenue for the company, in as many places as possible to sell more products.Amazon confirmed that Rochester, New York-based Vuzix's device will be the first smart glasses with Alexa. The company is ??excited about the potential of the glasses and the ability to bring Alexa to customers in a new way,?? a company spokeswoman said. Vuzix's shares gained 8.5 percent to $7 at 2:04 p.m. in New York after jumping as much as 16 percent on the news.Vuzix Blade glassesVoice assistants and augmented-reality products will be highlighted at next week's CES consumer electronics show. Executives from Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant will be seeking new partners and other big technology companies, including Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc.'s Oculus division, will be at the show behind the scenes as they ramp up their virtual-reality and augmented-reality products. AR is a technology that superimposes digital information such as maps, text messages and more onto a person's view of the real world, while VR submerses a user into a completely different digitally created world.Vuzix will release its AR glasses by the second quarter at a cost of about $1,000, Travers said. While it's a ??high price point,?? he said, ??the ultimate goal is to have it under $500, and we'll be able to do that?? by 2019. Wearers, who must be Amazon customers or become Amazon customers to enable Alexa's capabilities, could for example ask the digital assistant to pull up a map or display sports scores on the glasses.Workers assemble Vuzix Blade glasses.Amazon hasn't said whether it will release its own branded smart glasses with Alexa, but Travers expects it to happen.???I think everyone is going to come out with glasses sooner or later,?? he said.Apple is aiming to have the technology ready for its own augmented reality glasses by 2019 so that it can release a device by 2020, Bloomberg News reported last year. Oculus said it would release a $200 standalone VR headset called the Oculus Go this year that doesn't require connectivity to a PC or smartphone. Google was an early player in the AR glasses world, launching the Google Glass prototype before pulling back and focusing on adding AR features to its Pixel smartphone and releasing an enterprise-oriented headset.Amazon's first Alexa device launch was the Echo voice speaker in 2014, but the company has since released speakers with screens, tablets, and TV set-top boxes.For more on virtual assistants, check out the Decrypted podcast:"
Diarrhea Drug Imodium Swept Up in Opioid Crisis Under FDA Rules,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/diarrhea-drug-imodium-swept-up-in-opioid-crisis-under-fda-rules,"January 30, 2018, 9:31 AM EST",technology,"""FDA asks JJ; to limit number of antidiarrhea pills per box"", ""Large dosages of Imodium can produce opioid-like euphoria""","Boxes of Johnson & Johnson's popular antidiarrheal drug Imodium could soon contain far fewer caplets, under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration request that seeks to limit access of drug abusers to pills that can produce an opioid-like high.The FDA has asked J&J to reduce the number of caplets in over-the-counter retail packages of Imodium to provide for short-term diarrhea treatment, a move would be followed by?makers of generic versions of Imodium.?FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called the agency request ??fairly unprecedented?? in a statement on Tuesday and said those restrictions could constitute a two-day supply, or a maximum of eight two-milligram pills. J&J was noncommittal.The steps to limit Imodium are part of a broader FDA effort to stem the tide of overdose deaths. More than 42,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.?The FDA is also considering whether it can use packaging to stem access to certain fast-acting opioids such as Vicodin and Percocet that are meant for short-term use, Gottlieb said. For example, doctors may opt to prescribe fewer pills if such opioids were packaged in three- or six-day blister packs, he said.??Additionally, provided the FDA concluded that there was sufficient scientific support for these shorter durations of use, this could provide the basis for further regulatory action to drive more appropriate prescribing,?? Gottlieb said.The FDA warned in 2016 that people were using high doses of the active ingredient in Imodium, loperamide, to self-treat opioid withdrawal symptoms or to achieve a feeling of euphoria. Taking the drug in large quantities could lead to serious heart problems that could be fatal, according to the agency.??We're evaluating the agency's request and share their goal to prevent misuse and abuse,?? Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for J&J, said in an e-mail.On its?website, J&J links to sellers who offered Imodium in packages of 24 to 48 caplets. Other stores, including Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc., had generic versions?available online in bottles of as much as 200 pills. Gottlieb said packaging restrictions should make it easier to limit sales, and he plans to ask online retailers to address loperamide abuse.??If you're selling a drug with the potential for abuse and misuse through an online website, you're no longer in the business of selling widgets, or books,?? Gottlieb said. ??You have a social contract to take voluntary steps to help address public health challenges.??Ten deaths from loperamide use were reported to FDA from its approval in 1976 through Dec. 14, 2015. The agency hasn't updated those numbers, but it says abuse of the drug is on the rise.?"

The company didn't offer specifics.The faster connections will help carriers sell advanced services like virtual reality and 4K video, and enable self-driving cars. Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint Corp. also intend to offer mobile 5G services but haven't elaborated on their plans, though Verizon expects to introduce fixed service this year in a bid to replace cable and phone modems.While 5G technology offers a path for a slowing industry to revive growth, challenges abound. Mobile-phone companies, chipmakers, device manufacturers and software developers will need to spend about $200 billion a year in research and capital expenses to get there. And engineers will have to find ways to get the technology to work around interference from trees and rain and provide a strong enough signal to handle the anticipated demand.For AT&T, the push toward 5G has been a series of small steps over the past three years. ??Our strategy is to build targeted capabilities early and expand from that,?? said Gordon Mansfield, an AT&T vice president of network and device design.AT&T says it has laid the groundwork for 5G through network upgrades in 23 cities and fixed wireless trials in Kalamazoo, Michigan; South Bend, Indiana; and Waco and Austin, Texas. The company hasn't disclosed where it plans to launch mobile 5G initially or what airwaves or network equipment it plans to use.AT&T rose less than 1 percent to $37.89 at 11:26 a.m. in New York. The company started a court battle last month with U.S. Justice Department, which has sued to block its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. The stock declined 8.6 percent last year."
The Criminal Underworld Is Dropping Bitcoin for Another Currency,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/criminal-underworld-is-dropping-bitcoin-for-another-currency,"January 2, 2018, 5:00 AM EST",markets,"""Monero and others lure criminals as bitcoin's privacy weakens"", ""Some coins post fake blockchain entries to hamper surveillance""","Bitcoin is losing its luster with some of its earliest and most avid fans -- criminals -- giving rise to a new breed of virtual currency.Privacy coins such as monero, designed to avoid tracking, have climbed faster over the past two months as law enforcers adopt software tools to monitor people using bitcoin. A slew of analytic firms such as Chainalysis are getting better at flagging digital hoards linked to crime or money laundering, alerting exchanges and preventing conversion into traditional cash.The European Union's law-enforcement agency, Europol, raised alarms three months ago, writing in a report that ??other cryptocurrencies such as monero, ethereum and Zcash are gaining popularity within the digital underground.?? Online extortionists, who use ransomware to lock victims' computers until they fork over a payment, have begun demanding those currencies instead. On Dec. 18 hackers attacked up to 190,000 WordPress sites per hour to get them to produce monero, according to security company Wordfence.For ransomware attacks, monero is now ??one of the favorites, if not the favorite,?? Matt Suiche, founder of Dubai-based security firm Comae Technologies, said in a phone interview.Monero outperformed bitcoin in the final months of 2017 Source: Coinmarketcap.comNote: Figures shows percentage change in price compared with Oct. 31Monero quadrupled in value to $349 in the final two months of 2017, according to coinmarketcap.com, placing it among a number of upstart coins that rose faster than bitcoin, the world's most valuable digital currency. Bitcoin roughly doubled in the same period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Monero's price has climbed another 7 percent so far this year, according to coinmarketcap.com.Read more: Ripple's surge makes it the second-biggest cryptocurrencyIn monero's case, criminals are snapping it up because bitcoin's underlying technology can work against them. Called blockchain, the digital ledger meticulously records which addresses send and receive transactions, including the exact time and amount -- great data to use as evidence. Match an address to a crime and then watch the bitcoin universe carefully, and you can see the funds disappear and reappear in other locations.Sleuths have developed databases and techniques for digesting that information to eventually nab wrongdoers. Say, for example, a coffee shop in Berkeley is known to have a certain bitcoin address, and a wallet used by an extortionist transfers the same amount there every morning at 9 a.m. Police can stop by and make an arrest.Started in 2014, monero is very different. It encrypts the recipient's address on its blockchain and generates fake addresses to obscure the real sender. It also obscures the amount of the transaction.The techniques are so potent that software that flags coins suspected of being obtained through crime now tags just about anything converted into or out of monero as high risk, according to Pawel Kuskowski, chief executive officer of Coinfirm, which helps exchanges and other companies avoid tainted money. That compares with only about 10 percent of bitcoin, he said.??What we treat ??high risk' is something that's anonymizing funds,?? he said in a phone interview. ??How are you going to prove that these funds are not coming from illegal sources???Read a QuickTake: All about bitcoin, blockchain and their crypto worldMonero is one of many privacy-focused coins, each offering different security features. Its main competitor, Zcash -- which isn't known to have a significant criminal following -- can offer even better privacy protection. Instead of creating fake addresses to hide senders, it encrypts their true address. That makes it impossible to identify senders by looking for correlations in addresses used in multiple transactions to pinpoint the real one -- a vulnerability for monero. Developers of the coin have made progress in reducing it, though.Still, Princeton University researchers recently developed a tool that helps them analyze Zcash transactions at least to some extent -- but they haven't been able to crack monero. And Zcash high-security features can't be used on disposable burner phones, a favorite of criminals eager to stay anonymous.Developers behind monero say they simply created a coin that protects privacy. Most people use it legitimately -- they just don't want others to know whether they're buying a coffee or a car, Riccardo Spagni, core developer at monero, said in a phone interview.??As a community, we certainly don't advocate for monero's use by criminals,???Spagni said. ??At the same time if you have a decentralized currency, it's not like you can prevent someone from using it. I imagine that monero provides massive advantages for criminals over bitcoin, so they would use monero.??Yet criminals are probably only a fraction of monero's users, according to Lucas Nuzzi, a senior analyst at Digital Asset Research, which provides research to institutional investors.??As with any disruptive technology, many of the initial use cases revolve around illicit activities,?? he wrote in an email. But as everyday people grow concerned about privacy and surveillance, ??there is utility in these currencies that go beyond just a means of exchange for illicit goods.??For related news and information:Bitcoin price graph: XBT Curncy GP Cryptocurrency monitor: VCCYFor more on cryptocurrencies, check out the?Decrypted?podcast:?"

Current Xerox shareholders will receive a cash dividend of $9.80 per share. Tokyo-based Fujifilm will ultimately end up owning 50.1 percent of the combined entity, which expands the joint venture to encompass all of Xerox's operations.The agreement marks the end of independence for a U.S. company whose roots trace back to the start of the 20th century. Xerox became famous for its hardware -- its copiers were so ubiquitous that the name Xerox became a verb -- and it also invented an early graphic interface and mouse now so familiar with modern computers. But it fell on hard times as Canon Inc. and Asian competitors eroded its dominance while email and other forms of electronic communications took over.Activist investor Carl Icahn had pushed Xerox to explore ??strategic options,?? including shaking up its joint venture with Fujifilm, and electing four new directors. Icahn, along with investor Darwin Deason, also called for Xerox to replace Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson. He will become CEO of the new combined company.??They probably felt pressured to do something because Icahn and them are going to get their way,?? but the deal isn't going to be a game changer for the business, said Argus Research Corp. analyst Jim Kelleher. The office equipment and copier industry as a whole is shrinking, a decline that Xerox has been managing steadily, he said.??I don't think Icahn thought this was a transformative deal, but a way to jazz up the stock price a little,?? Kelleher said.

Jacobson said in the statement.Fujifilm executives said in a press conference Wednesday in Tokyo they were confident all shareholders will approve the deal. The new combined company, Fuji Xerox, will trade on the New York Stock Exchange and have dual headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut, and Tokyo.Fujifilm Holdings,?which lowered its forecast for operating income for the year ending March 31, will cut one-fifth of its global workforce at the joint venture. The company said it?will incur a one-time expense of 72 billion yen ($662 million) over three years.The Japanese company, which generates almost 60 percent of sales from overseas, is pushing to offset waning demand at its printer and copier hardware business by shifting focus to managed-print services and medical imaging. Expansion into the health-care sector with products such as ultrasound and endoscope equipment should boost sales, but that segment's thinner margins could offset gains in the imaging division, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Fujifilm's stock plunged in the final minutes of trading in Tokyo on Wednesday before the deal was announced, dropping more than 8 percent to the lowest level since August.??

It was a coming-out party?for the?Google Home Max, a smart speaker that went on sale this week. As the 30 or 40 revelers mingled, they took a moment to congratulate?themselves; a single Max speaker was filling the cavernous space with the stylings of rapper Kendrick Lamar.?The Home Max is a traditional speaker design??it resembles the Sonos?Play 5?model??and?wouldn't look out of place in a media room. The sound quality?is impressive. So is its ability to pick up a user's voice even when the volume is cranked to 90 percent of capacity. The gadget is part of a ??living room?? strategy to get consumers to use?Google?Assistant, Play music, YouTube and Chromecast??and not Apple and Amazon products and services.Here's?the thing: Does the world really need another smart speaker??especially one priced at a lofty?$400? Apple, Sonos?and Amazon have all unveiled quality smart speakers this year. And they're all cheaper. Moreover, Google Glass, the company's?best-known gadget, flopped and the company only started making a name for itself in?consumer hardware last year.Carolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst at Creative Strategies, said Google will have to overcome several challenges, including a report?that its Mini smart speaker was surreptitiously recording conversations, prompting the company to temporarily disable the device's touch controls. ??That coupled with an unproven track record on hardware will make it hard for Google at that price point,?? she said. ??I see the biggest opportunity in consumers who are heavily entrenched in the ecosystem and use Google Assistant on their phone a lot.??During an interview?at Google headquarters, Home Max hardware chief James Howarth talked up the audio industry ??veterans?? on his team (Apple has those too). Chris Chan,?who helped design?the audio software, said Google?gained experience working on speakers for its Pixel phones and?smaller Home speakers. Members of the Google Home team also said the Max was exhaustively tested and is every bit as good as the competition.Like most gadgets of this ilk, the speaker was optimized in an anechoic chamber??a super-quiet room used to test audio products. Situated in a nondescript building off a parking lot, the chamber is about the size of a small bedroom. The Home Max was hooked up to a machine that spins 360 degrees so the engineers could hear how it sounded from any angle. A microphone sent the audio to computers for analysis.?To get a more subjective response, the team?enlisted a panel of audio experts to listen to song samples and select differently tuned versions of each one. Panel members voted on their tuning preferences much the way a patient gives feedback during an eye exam. Audio engineers used the responses to further tweak the sound. Google?employees also took the speaker home for further testing and feedback.?The speaker is 13.2 inches wide, 7.4 inches tall and 6 inches deep??about twice the height of Apple's HomePod?if stood upright??and Google?designed the drivers in-house. They are big and heavy and the base of the device is filled with hard plastic so it doesn't go flying. As a result,?the speaker?weighs in at a chunky 12 pounds, about twice the heft of the HomePod.?The Home Max doesn't break much new ground technologically. Like speakers from Apple and Sonos, it?automatically adjusts the audio depending?on where it's placed in a room. Google engineers cooked up?their own version, which involved analyzing?Sonos's?Trueplay?mechanism?in the last couple of months of development.?Called?Smart Sound, the technology uses?machine learning to figure out a room's size and shape.Isabelle Olsson, the project's lead hardware designer, said Google went through ??hundreds and hundreds?? of prototypes, but declined?to describe?nixed designs in case they show up in future devices. One key challenge: picking the yarn that covers the front of the speaker. Looking for fabric that looked good and wouldn't impede the sound, the team?rummaged through 300 choices before selecting the?material at an Austrian mill.Google declined to say whether it plans to expand the Home lineup. But two people familiar with the matter said the company is working on a touchscreen version, akin to Amazon's Echo Show. (TechCrunch?previously reported the news.) The device is codenamed ??Manhattan?? and will?go on sale as early as next year. In the meantime, the search giant?will have to overcome?a history of?product flops and take on Amazon, Apple and Sonos."

Google's ??Dutch Sandwich' Shielded 16 Billion Euros From Tax,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/google-s-dutch-sandwich-shielded-16-billion-euros-from-tax,"January 2, 2018, 10:23 AM EST",technology,"""Amount for 2016 was seven percent higher than the year before"", ""Tax shelter saved Google billions of dollars in 2016""","Alphabet Inc.'s Google moved 15.9 billion euros ($19.2 billion) to a Bermuda shell company in 2016, regulatory filings in the Netherlands show -- saving the company billions of dollars in taxes that year.Google uses two structures, known as a ??Double Irish?? and a ??Dutch Sandwich,?? to shield the majority of its international profits from taxation. The setup involves shifting revenue from one Irish subsidiary to a Dutch company with no employees, and then on to a Bermuda mailbox owned by another Ireland-registered company.The amount of money Google moved through this tax structure in 2016 was 7 percent higher than the year before, according to company filings with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce dated Dec. 22 and which were made available online Tuesday. News of the filings was first reported by the Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad.??We pay all of the taxes due and comply with the tax laws in every country we operate in around the world,?? a Google spokesman said in a statement.???We remain committed to helping grow the online ecosystem.??Google is under pressure from regulators and authorities around the world for not paying enough tax. Last year, the company escaped a 1.12 billion euro French tax bill after a court ruled its Irish subsidiary, which collects revenue for ads the company sells in France, had no permanent base in the country. The European Union has been exploring ways to make U.S. technology companies, many of which use similar tax shelters, pay more.The Irish government closed the tax loophole that permitted ??Double Irish?? tax arrangements in 2015. But companies already using the structure are allowed to continue employing it until the end of 2020.According to U.S. financial filings, Google's global effective tax rate in 2016 was 19.3 percent, which it achieved in part by shifting the majority of its international profit to the Bermuda-based entity. Applying that tax rate, Google would have saved $3.7 billion via the 2016 transfer.Tax expert Robert Willens said a better way to calculate Google's savings would be to apply Ireland's 12.5 percent tax rate to the amount of money shifted to Bermuda because the income would otherwise have been taxed there. Under that scenario, Google would have saved about $2.4 billion in taxes.Google held $60.7 billion overseas at the end of 2016 on which it hadn't yet paid U.S. income taxes or ??foreign withholding taxes,?? the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.For years, U.S. tax law has given American companies an incentive to keep their foreign earnings offshore by allowing them to defer U.S. taxes until they return those profits to the U.S. But that changes this year; the U.S. tax law passed last month will require companies to pay taxes on the overseas income they've stockpiled to date at one of two rates: 15.5 percent for income held as cash or cash equivalents and 8 percent for less liquid assets.Going forward, U.S. companies that pay relatively low global effective tax rates -- a sign that they're using tax havens -- would pay a minimum U.S. tax. That new tax, which begins at a rate of 10.5 percent, wouldn't apply in cases where a company's global effective tax rate is 13.125 percent or higher.Google Ireland Ltd. collects most of the company's international advertising revenue and then passes this money on to Dutch subsidiary Google Netherlands Holdings BV. A Google subsidiary in Singapore that collects most of the company's revenue in the Asia-Pacific region does the same.The Dutch company then transfers this money on to Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited, which has the right to license the search giant's intellectual property outside the U.S. That company is based in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. The use of the two Irish entities is what gives the structure its ??Double Irish?? moniker and the use of the Netherlands subsidiary as a conduit between the two Irish companies is the ??Dutch Sandwich.????

Robot Delivery Vans Are Arriving Before Self-Driving Cars,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/nuro-has-built-a-robot-van-to-deliver-your-stuff,"January 30, 2018, 6:00 AM EST",hyperdrive,,"The future of driverless driving looks like a giant toaster with a funny hat.That's an approximation of a new autonomous vehicle unveiled Tuesday by Nuro, a Silicon Valley startup that's been cryptic about its business plan since it launched about 18 months ago. Nuro's shiny, minimalist appliance on wheels doesn't have doors or windows to speak of, because it will be carrying packages??not people.As every major automaker and dozens of tech companies race to replace drivers in Uber?cars and taxi fleets, Nuro is ignoring humans altogether and steering for Amazon.com Inc., United Parcel Service?Inc. and any retailer looking to build its e-commerce business.???We realized we could make it possible to deliver anything, anytime, anywhere,?? said co-founder Dave Ferguson. ??We like to call it a local teleportation service.??Nuro's delivery pod weighs about 1,500 pounds, with most of that mass packed into a battery pack that powers its electric motor. It's roughly the same length and height as?a conventional SUV, but only 3.5 feet wide. There is a glass windshield, mostly just to keep other drivers from freaking out.Each will come with a modular, customizable interior that can carry about 250 pounds. A grocer will be able to opt for shelves and refrigeration; a dry-cleaner can go with hanging racks; while peer-to-peer versions?shuffling the detritus of Craigslist may have two empty cargo bays with some anchoring straps. ??We spent a bunch of time doing ergonomic experiments,???Ferguson said.Along the spectrum of self-driving technology, Nuro's?cargo vehicle falls somewhere between a car from the?""The?Jetsons""?and one of those smart suitcases that follow travelers around the airport.?To be sure, the market is massive. UPS alone delivers about 19 million packages a day. Excluding management and pilots, it employs roughly 353,000 people and spends 57 cents of every sales dollar on compensation and benefits. Robot-cars, meanwhile,?are far easier to negotiate with at review time and ask only for some electricity.Of course, Nuro isn't the first company to notice the Amazon Prime packages piling up on porches. Ford Motor Co.?began testing?human-free pizza delivery with Domino's last summer. Toyota Motor Corp. rolled out a delivery?vehicle in Las Vegas this month; dubbed e-Palette, the futuristic van?already has?partnerships with Amazon.com and Pizza Hut. Renault-Nissan plans to unveil a driverless delivery van in September. Udelv?Inc., a self-driving startup, is testing an autonomous delivery vehicle in California this month.However, Nuro, by all accounts a scrappy newcomer, has some street cred. Co-founders Jiajun Zhu (who goes by ??Jay-Z??) was one of the first engineers working on Waymo, the self-driving unit launched by Google (now Alphabet Inc.) Ferguson, who has a Ph.D. in robotics from Carnegie Mellon,?joined him there in 2011.??Since leaving Waymo, the pair has?rounded up $92 million of?venture capital over two rounds led by Banyan Capital and Greylock Partners. The company's most critical asset, however, may be its staff. It's lured dozens of workers from Bay Area giants, including Apple Inc., Google, Tesla Inc. and Uber?Technologies Inc. And it's given them a?relatively uncomplicated mission: Don't worry about passengers.?The Nuro?vehicle, compared with similar robot cars, is skinny and slow, both of which make it relatively safe. It can avoid an errant?child, for example, without leaving its lane. Meanwhile, it's in no particular rush. ??Most of these things?sort of drive like my grandma,?? Ferguson said. ??If someone's inside the vehicle, that's annoying. If no one's inside the vehicle, that's actually a strictly positive thing.??As such, Nuro?believes cargo vehicles have a clearer, quicker path to profit than the?30 or so outfits?that incorporate?sentient beings who must emerge unscathed. ??Passenger self-driving, to [these companies], is an existential threat; they have to get it right,?? Ferguson said.???Whereas, for us, there are just some things we don't need to worry about.??Alexander Hars, managing director at Inventivio, a German self-driving consultancy, expects the number of players in the self-driving space to peak soon and then shrink quickly. The network effects enjoyed by the first movers will make it tough for the rest of the field to catch up.??I think it will shake out very quickly,?? Hars explained. ??The manufacturing is an essential part.??This is where Nuro?may be trailing General Motors Co., Tesla and others. While its?nifty vehicle seems to be in the vanguard, Nuro has yet to ink agreements with manufacturing partners??or customers, for that matter, though the company?said it's?in talks with a few major retailers. Its?mission, for the time being, is to get its vehicles on U.S. roads sometime this year, performing some kind of???useful service.????It's ambitious,?? Ferguson said with a laugh. ??We're uncomfortably excited about that goal.?? There is one downside about delivery vehicles without drivers, though: You'll have to go outside to get your stuff. While the tricky, so-called last-mile of delivery may soon be solved by the likes of Nuro, that last 50 feet will require better robots.For more on self-driving vehicles, check out the Decrypted podcast:?"

Based on the latest price of the country's oil basket, the total issue would be worth about $5.9 billion.??I have ordered the issuance of 100 million petros with the legal support of Venezuela's oil wealth,?? Maduro said.?He said the cryptocurrency will help the South American country challenge the ??tyranny of the dollar,?? economic war and U.S.-led financial persecution. Over the past year, the U.S. Treasury Department has blacklisted numerous top-ranking officials, including Maduro and many of his ministers.Years of government mismanagement have left Venezuela beset by quadruple-digit inflation, severe shortages of food and medicine as well as four straight years of recession, forcing the government to restructure or refinance its foreign debt. Home to the world's largest crude reserves, Venezuelan oil output fell to a 14-year low last July.Maduro didn't comment on whether Venezuela bondholders would be paid with petros. He said yesterday that a commission to restructure or refinance foreign debt is ??working very well.??At the start, the petro will be obtained through auctions or direct allocation by the country's Cryptocurrency Superintendent, Maduro said. Virtual cryptocurrency exchanges are still in a trial stage, he said.The vice president and?economy vice president will meet with the central bank Jan. 8 to relaunch the Dicom foreign exchange system, Maduro said. The renewed system will include ??new mechanisms?? and will seek to the capture ??growing?? remittances from Venezuelans abroad, he said."

The Air Resources Board already mandates sales of zero-emission passenger vehicles.Several California cities are electrifying their fleets already. The Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- one of the biggest public-transit agencies in the countries -- has pledged to convert all 2,200 buses in its fleet to zero-emission models by 2030."

The deal hasn't been finalized and could still fall apart.Fox's pursuit of ??Thursday Night Football?? is a sign of its strategic direction after a planned sale of assets to Walt Disney Co. for $52.4 billion. The Murdoch family, which runs the company, wants to prove to the market that it's still very interested in sports, the people said.CBS and NBC paid a combined $450 million to air 10 games last year. The networks bid again this year, but their enthusiasm has waned with NFL ratings down 9.7 percent this past regular season.TV executives, including Fox Chief Executive Officer James Murdoch, have blamed the Thursday game for declines in viewership over the past couple seasons, arguing the market has become saturated, with other matchups airing on Sunday and Monday. The cost of rights has risen even as the audience for football on TV has shrunk.?Football is still the most-watched program on TV, a vital lure of advertising sales and fees from cable operators. A Thursday night game would boost Fox, which ranks last among the broadcast networks in total audience and is tied for second among viewers 18 to 49.Fox agreed last month to sell cable channels FX and National Geographic, its movie and TV studio and international assets to Disney. If that deal gets approved by regulators, the new Fox will be much smaller, with broadcast, news and sports channels.Fox shares were unchanged in early New York trading, while Disney rose 0.8 percent to $110.99."

The move coincides with the aggressive expansion of UberEATS in the country, even as the rivals continue to vie for leadership in ride-summoning.Ola, which attempted its own grocery and food delivery services before shutting them in 2016, gains Foodpanda's roster of some 12,000 restaurants in more than 100 Indian cities. It's also getting into a low-margin business that's spurred the failure of dozens of Indian foodtech startups. The segment's largest players have consolidated their operations in the past two years by acquiring smaller players.UberEATS made its India debut in May and has quickly ramped up to over half a dozen cities. The $200 million investment in Foodpanda will be the largest deal of its kind in India's online food-ordering and delivery segment, Ola said. The ride-hailing giant said it intends to grow Foodpanda by marrying its own scale and transport network with Delivery Hero's expertise."

New cloud bookings, a keenly watched metric for future sales growth, grew 31 percent at constant currencies.Trump's tax plan was ""extremely well received?? by CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, McDermott said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.?McDermott and Trump in Davos on Jan. 25.""There was not a single CEO I talked to that wasn't feeling good about the economic momentum,?? he said.

Investors flocking to open new accounts or place orders Thursday left Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, warning of outages and slow transactions.?Trezor, a wallet service, tweeted that it's having ??minor issues?? with its servers, while Bitfinex, the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, said on Twitter that it has been under a denial of service attack for several days and that it recently got worse.Bitcoin listed at $16,395 as of 1:15 p.m. in Bloomberg pricing that is a composite of exchanges.?That takes its rally this year past 1,500 percent and its market capitalization is now at $274 billion. On Thursday it topped out at $16,777.08 after starting the day at $13,363.25.???This is irrational exuberance,?? Royal Bank of Scotland Chairman Howard John Davies said in an interview on Bloomberg TV on Thursday. ??This is a very, very unusual market, that shows we're not in a normal two-way trading market.??Daily price swings of that magnitude and weakness at the exchanges underscored concerns raised Wednesday by?some of the world's biggest brokerages, which told regulators the contracts have been rushed to market without enough due diligence. The new bitcoin derivatives products are slated to begin trading this month and are expected to boost mainstream demand.?On a day such as Thursday, trading would pause under proposed daily price-swing limitations.The slowdown on exchanges also highlighted the disparate pricing that can occur. The surging demand on Coinbase sent prices as high as $19,697 at 11:23 a.m., higher by more than $3,000 than other exchanges. Coinbase added at least 300,000 users since just before the Thanksgiving holiday. The company had 13.3 million users as of Nov. 26, up from 13 million on Nov. 22 and 10.6 million two months ago.Davies agreed with the brokerages' concerns that exchanges which are set to offer bitcoin futures and options have failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing. Those warnings were laid out in an open letter via the Futures Industry Association on Wednesday.Cboe Global Markets Inc. has said it will start trading bitcoin futures on Dec. 10, while CME Group Inc.'s contracts are set to debut on Dec. 18. Nasdaq Inc. is planning to offer futures in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. Cantor Fitzgerald LP's Cantor Exchange is creating a bitcoin derivative, and startup LedgerX already offers options.ASX Ltd.,?the main exchange operator for equities and derivatives in Australia, on Thursday said it will start using blockchain, the technology that underlies bitcoin, to process equity transactions. The digital currency also got a boost from a successful test of a technology that will attempt to ease congestion in purchases of the digital currency.Lightning Network, as the technology is known, was conceived to move some transactions away from the blockchain, by allowing buyers and sellers to transact privately and later broadcast their activity to the public network.The price of bitcoin cash fell on the news, slumping 9.1 percent to $1,342.86, according to prices on coinmarketcap.com.

"John Young, Only One to Walk on Moon and Fly Shuttle, Dies at 87",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-06/john-young-only-person-to-walk-on-moon-fly-shuttle-dies-at-87,"January 6, 2018, 2:04 PM EST",technology,"""Astronaut was one of only 12 people to step on lunar surface"", ""He criticized NASA for placing launch schedules above safety""","John Young, one of only 12 humans to walk on the moon and commander of NASA's first space shuttle mission, has died. He was 87.He died Friday following complications from pneumonia, according to a statement from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The agency didn't say where he died.John YoungThe longest-serving astronaut in the space program, Young's career began as a Navy test flier. He was the only moon walker to pilot a space shuttle, the first person to go into space six times and the only one to fly and command four types of spacecraft -- Gemini, Apollo, lunar module and shuttle.??NASA and the world have lost a pioneer,?? Robert Lightfoot, NASA administrator, said in the statement. ??Astronaut John Young's storied career spanned three generations of spaceflight; we will stand on his shoulders as we look toward the next human frontier.??Young's achievements were paired with a laconic style and a heartbeat that barely jumped after liftoff. He was a stickler for safety, which benefited and exasperated NASA officials.??He was quite an asset to the space program,?? Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell said, according to an interview with the Orlando Sentinel when Young retired in 2004. ??He was always questioning what we were doing and why we were doing it.??Young joined NASA in 1962. His earliest voyage into space was on Gemini 3, the agency's first two-man flight, commanded by Virgil ??Gus?? Grissom, in 1965.The next year, on Gemini 10, Young and Mike Collins completed a dual docking and other maneuvers as prelude to the Apollo program's quest to put a man on the moon.On Apollo 10, in May 1969, NASA performed what it called ??a full dress rehearsal?? for landing men on the moon two months later. Young remained in the command capsule as Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan descended in a lunar module to within 9 miles of the moon's surface. Returning to Earth, they set a record still not equaled by a manned vehicle, going 32 times the speed of sound, or 24,816 miles per hour.John Young salutes on the surface of the Moon on April 21, 1972.In April 1972, aboard Apollo 16, Young became the ninth member of the exclusive club of moon walkers. Bouncing along the lunar surface in a four-wheeled rover, he and Charlie Duke collected 200 pounds of rock specimens.Once the U.S. had beaten the Soviet Union's cosmonauts to the moon and funding dried up, Young pushed NASA to return to the moon or venture to Mars, to provide the human race with a backup home in the event of Earth's destruction.??Earth's geologic history is pretty clear: It says, quite frankly, that single-planet species don't last,?? Young said, according to a 2004 Houston Chronicle story.Young became chief of NASA's Astronaut Office, supervising training of new recruits and helping to develop the shuttle, the first fixed-wing space vehicle designed for reuse.In 1981, Young commanded the shuttle program's inaugural mission, orbiting Earth 37 times in the Columbia. It was the first time NASA put men on a vehicle's initial voyage, and the earliest manned spacecraft launched by solid rocket boosters.He commanded the Columbia again in 1983, his final journey into the cosmos.Young already had a history of acting as a watchdog for crew safety and firing off blunt memorandums when the Challenger exploded shortly after takeoff in January 1986, killing all seven aboard. A memo he had sent three weeks earlier, leaked to the media after the tragedy, criticized NASA for compromising protection to meet launch schedules.In news interviews and testimony to the presidential commission that investigated the accident, he warned that space shuttles would continue to reveal defects.??The technical truth always has to be told, and telling it regardless of the consequences was one of my personality traits that people who knew me well learned to put up with,?? Young wrote in ??Forever Young,?? his 2012 autobiography.Young was reassigned in 1987 as special assistant for engineering, operations and safety at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, a move he viewed as punishment for his outspokenness.??I wrote my memos to hit people over the head: with facts, with what-ifs, with contingencies, with options to contingencies, and with the stupidity and danger of absurd and ludicrous bureaucratic decisions,?? Young wrote about the 2003 loss of the shuttle Columbia and seven more lives. ??In retrospect, it's just so damn hard to believe that we hadn't pinpointed the problem.??John Watts Young was born Sept. 24, 1930, in San Francisco to William Young and Wanda Howland Young. The family moved to Cartersville, Georgia, and then Orlando, Florida, as his father sought work during the Depression.Young earned a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta in 1952. He was an aviator in the Korean War and remained in the Navy as a test pilot until joining the astronaut corps.Even after he was moved to a desk job, Young kept his credentials current and remained a qualified astronaut until retiring at age 74.He acknowledged being haunted by the deaths of the two shuttle crews and of close friend Grissom, killed with two other astronauts in the 1967 fire during a test countdown for what was to have been Apollo 1.??Even today, approaching a half century later, I swallow hard when I think back to the Apollo 1 fire and the deaths of our buddies,?? Young wrote in his memoir.Young was married to the former Susy Feldman. With his first wife, Barbara White Young, he had two children, John Jr. and Sandra."
India's Fortis Weighs Options to Raise $790 Million Capital,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-05/fortis-in-talks-for-fresh-capital-as-part-of-singhs-stake-sale-jc1erbu9,"January 4, 2018, 11:16 PM EST",technology,"""Founders in talks with PE firms to sell holding: president"", ""Company seeks cash to partly pay for RHT Health Trust purchase""","Fortis Healthcare Ltd. is seeking a cash injection of as much as 50 billion rupees ($790 million) as part of its billionaire founders' talks to sell their stake in India's second-largest private hospital chain, according to President?Daljit Singh.Malvinder and Shivinder Singh have been in talks with private equity firms for the past year to sell their 34 percent stake in Fortis to pay down debt at their holding company, Daljit Singh said in an interview Thursday.?The deal could also bring fresh capital for Fortis that would be used to partly finance the acquisition of its Singapore-based trust, announced in November, he said.Fortis is also exploring other structures for a capital infusion, which could result in dilution for existing shareholders, Singh said from the company's headquarters in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi. Fortis has a market value of about $1.3 billion.A spokesman for RHC Holding Pvt, the Singhs' holding company, said the brothers are complying with India's court order to not sell their holding in Fortis as part of an on-going dispute with Japan's?Daiichi Sankyo Co. and aren't in talks with PE firms on a stake sale.??In order to take care of the group's problems we need to infuse money into the organization -- the promoters need to get money,?? Singh said, referring to the founders using a term that connotes they have control of the company. ??There have been discussions with prospective partners to invest either a primary infusion or to buy out the shares of the promoters in a manner that makes sense for the entire group.??Singh declined to name the firms involved in the negotiations. Bloomberg reported in March?the Singh brothers were in talks with private equity firm TPG Capital LP and Kuala Lumpur-based hospital operator IHH Healthcare Bhd. to explore an investment in Fortis.?The efforts to raise cash come at a difficult time for both Fortis and its owners. While the credit rating of the Singhs' main holding company was downgraded to ??default?? for missing an interest payment, Fortis has struggled to remain profitable in recent years, caught between rising costs and government efforts to restrict what they can charge patients.??Today it's probably the least attractive investment proposition from a business point of view,?? said Singh, who is not related to the founders who are Fortis' largest shareholders. ??You've got to be a dud to invest in health care.??A potential Fortis deal could be complicated by an ongoing court case with Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo. India's top court has ordered the Singh brothers not to sell or dilute their shareholding in Fortis until it decides on Daiichi's petition to place a longer-term halt on asset sales by the Singhs.Daiichi is trying to enforce an award of about $500 million by a Singapore tribunal which found the brothers concealed critical information during the sale of their generic drug firm, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., to Daiichi in 2008. The Singhs are contesting that ruling.In the meantime, profitability has emerged as a key issue at Fortis and across India's private hospital space in the last year as the government imposed price controls on coronary stents and knee implants, impacting margins. Fortis shares have declined about 12 percent in the past year. The company's stock surged as much as 4.4 percent Friday, before giving up gains. Shares slid 0.5 percent to 163.30 rupees at the close. Fortis reported a negative profit margin in the fourth quarter and 0.5 percent for the first quarter that ended June. That makes Singh's task of raising money for a hospital business more difficult, he said.??When you aggregate everything together, we are not making money, or we are at best making low money,?? he said.To counter those headwinds, Singh said Fortis has engaged in a campaign of cost controls; cutting head office staff, standardizing processes and finding ways to reduce the amount of time patients have to stay in the hospital. He projects that in two years, the company's margin on earnings before interest, taxes and other expenses will go to around 20 percent from 7.9 percent last year.Singh said the the company's?purchase of?its Singapore-listed RHT Health Trust for an enterprise value of 46.5 billion rupees will work to increase the hospital chain's profitability and make the business more attractive to investors who see potential in India's largely-private health care sector. The trust has acted as a kind of landlord to Fortis' hospitals.When it announced the transaction, Fortis said it was in talks with financial and strategic partners to raise 50 billion rupees with a combination of equity, quasi-equity and debt.??They are also very concerned about the returns,?? he said of investors. ??They are very concerned about how money will actually be made on the ground.????

They have ample motivation to do so: While Oracle's database is widely considered the world's most advanced, it's also expensive compared with the competition, the Information reported. Oracle's shares slid in New York Tuesday.Amazon began exploring Oracle alternatives in the early 2000s, and is further along, according to the report. It has already switched over two internal databases that underpin its massive e-commerce operation to open-source NoSQL from Oracle, the Information said, citing two people with knowledge of the change.Salesforce, which uses Oracle's database in its customer management and marketing automation software, has also been developing a database replacement, code-named Sayonara -- Japanese for ??goodbye?? -- and is now ready to deploy it internally, the Information reported, citing a former Salesforce employee with knowledge of the matter. Salesforce expects to be completely weaned of Oracle by 2023, the person said, according to the publication.Oracle, Salesforce and Amazon declined to comment to the Information.Redwood City, California-based Oracle had almost $38 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ended in May. The company co-founded by Larry Ellison sells a variety of business software applications and hardware products, but its database software -- used by most of the Fortune 500 companies -- is its flagship product.Oracle shares were down 1.4 percent to $46.62 at 11:24 a.m. in New York. They are up 21 percent in the past 12 months."

The decision comes a year after European Union privacy authorities said they had ??serious concerns?? about the sharing of WhatsApp user data for purposes that weren't included in the terms of service and privacy policy when people signed up to the service.CNIL ??decided to make this formal notice public in order to ensure the highest level of transparency on the massive data transfer from WhatsApp to Facebook Inc. and thus to alert to the need for individuals concerned to keep their data under control,?? the regulator said in a statement on its website on Monday.Facebook faces regulatory hurdles throughout Europe over a range of privacy issues. Germany's Federal Cartel Office in preliminary findings published Tuesday criticized Facebook's data collection practices, saying the company abusively requires users to allow it collect data from web use beyond its site. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook rejected the German authority's findings as giving an ??inaccurate picture.??WhatsApp said that privacy is very important to it and that ??it's why we collect very little data, and encrypt every message.????We will continue to work with the CNIL to ensure users understand what information we collect, as well as how it's used,?? WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. ??We're committed to resolving the different, and at times conflicting concerns we've heard from European data protection authorities with a common EU approach before?? new bloc-wide data protection rules enter into force in May 2018.The merging of WhatsApp's data with Facebook was a first step by Facebook last year toward monetizing the platform since the social network's Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg bought the company for about $22 billion in 2014. The EU's 28 privacy chiefs were critical from the start and as part of their probes across the bloc, in a letter to WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum in October that stressed their concerns.The data transfers from WhatsApp to Facebook happen in part without the users' consent, nor the legitimate interest of WhatsApp, CNIL said.The authority rejected arguments by WhatsApp that it is subject only to the law of the U.S., saying that it becomes the authority in charge the moment any company is processing data in France.The French regulator in its statement on Monday said the formal notice wasn't a sanction, but WhatsApp would risk fines at a later stage if it failed to comply.??

While it took 13 months for the firm to get its first $100 million in assets under management, it added $100 million yesterday alone,?Chief Executive Officer Andy Rachleff said in an interview. The new round should be ??more than enough?? to see them through to becoming profitable, he said.With a client base that skews younger than most online-based advisers -- more than three-fourths of customers are under the age of 45 --?the firm has made a large push into financial planning since its last funding round in 2014. It's also been focusing on investment management and banking services, and Rachleff says Wealthfront plans to ??even more aggressively expand into those services than we have in the past.??The expansion as well as the young customer base was a key selling point to bringing on Tiger Global Management as an investor in the latest funding round.??Wealthfront's exclusively software-based model gives the company a superior approach to capture the younger, fast-growing market of investors,?? said Lee Fixel, a partner at Tiger Global. ??We're excited to support continued growth of the business and help Wealthfront become to the millennial generation what Charles Schwab is to baby boomers.??The startup, based in Redwood City, California, declined to comment on valuation, but was previously valued at $700 million when it raised money in 2014, according to CB Insights. Existing institutional investors also participated in the latest round, including Benchmark Capital, Greylock Partners, Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Social Capital and Spark Capital Growth. Rachleff also co-founded Benchmark Capital.Wealth management startups took off shortly after the financial crisis, capitalizing on the rise of passive investing as well as mobile applications and websites that appealed to millennials in particular. Last year saw some of the biggest banks and established wealth managers spend millions of dollars on financial technology to transform decades-old offerings, leading to growing competition from the incumbents. Expansion from other wealth startups is also strong, with Betterment LLC amassing $12 billion since launching in 2010 and closing a financing round in 2017 that saw its valuation hit $800 million."
Qualcomm to Face EU Antitrust Rebuke for Apple Payments,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/qualcomm-is-said-to-face-eu-antitrust-rebuke-for-apple-payments,"December 14, 2017, 1:34 PM EST",technology,"""Penalty for breaching antitrust rules may come within weeks"", ""EU also probing Qualcomm modems, dropped earlier patent case""","Qualcomm Inc. is likely to be penalized in the coming weeks by the European Union for paying Apple Inc. to shun rival chip companies, according to a person familiar with the case.Regulators are set to find the company violated antitrust law by using incentive payments to ensure exclusivity, the person said, asking not to be cited by name because the investigation is ongoing. EU officials have been studying a September ruling involving Intel Corp. that raised similar issues and could issue findings on Qualcomm as soon as next month, according to the person. The person didn't discuss a potential fine, which is widely expected.Qualcomm is already fighting with Apple in numerous court cases around the world over patent licensing. Apple has also been making moves to develop iPhones and iPads without Qualcomm components. The San Diego-based company is separately trying to ward off a proposed takeover by Broadcom Ltd.Apple says Qualcomm charges too much and is leveraging its strong market position in chips illegally. Qualcomm counters that Apple, one of its largest customers, has lied to regulators in an unfair attempt to bully it into charging less.Qualcomm and the European Commission, the EU's antitrust arm, declined to comment. Apple had no immediate comment.The EU previously said Qualcomm's payments to a smartphone manufacturer it didn't name were harmful to competition because they reduced incentives to source chips elsewhere and may have limited innovation for so-called UMTS and LTE baseband chipsets.The case has some parallels with the EU's 2009 finding that Intel's rebates to computer manufacturers and payments to a retailer were aimed at squeezing out a smaller chipmaker. The EU's top court has ordered a lower tribunal to reexamine Intel's appeal and weigh whether the EU can merely assume that such tactics are illegal without proving they were harmful to rivals and competition.A negative decision would be the first time the EU has finalized an investigation into Qualcomm. Officials dropped a four-year probe in 2009 into how it licensed patents used in the 3G phone standard. There was no fine or any finding that Qualcomm violated antitrust rules in that case.A second EU probe, still underway, centers on whether Qualcomm deliberately sold chipsets for internet dongles at below-cost from 2009 to 2011 to hinder competitor Icera, now owned by Nvidia Inc. That case has escalated with a court dispute over information the EU sought from the company. Qualcomm was threatened with additional daily fines for not quickly supplying data the EU wanted.??

China's largest online wealth management and payments service may now have to throttle back plans to expand in the world's largest financial market as it begins preparations to go public in the next year or so.The end of the bid comes almost a year after Ma met with then President-elect Donald Trump and talked of creating a million U.S. jobs. Ant Financial's $1.2 billion deal for Dallas-based MoneyGram?would've added a network of 350,000 agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories that it says reaches billions of accounts.?The U.S. company's shares plunged as much as 17 percent in extended trading.But the deal faced intense scrutiny?from a government panel that's become more active in blocking Chinese investments. Ant submitted its proposal to the the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. several times, to no avail. Last spring, two House of Representatives members said the acquisition could allow ??malicious actors?? to obtain data on U.S. military personnel and their families who use the service. Ant and Moneygram now plan to work together on initiatives in remittance and digital payments, they said in a joint statement.???Technology companies understand the situation and are evolving in their approach. They are doing more things organically, they are doing more strategic alliances,?? Jeremy Choy, head of M&A for China Renaissance, told Bloomberg Television. ??We don't think this is the start of a trend where people just won't do things in the U.S. A lot of technology companies are becoming increasingly global, so they have to go to the U.S. But?in terms of the approach, it will be less direct than finding a target and buying 100 percent.??Jack Ma Needs to Prove He's Serious About Coming to America: GadflyAnt Financial -- formerly part of Ma's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -- is already a behemoth in China, providing services from wealth management and insurance to credit checks and consumer loans.?Formally known as Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co., the company was valued at $75 billion by Hong Kong investment group CLSA in 2016 and is expected to go public eventually. Its Alipay platform has built itself into an online giant that controls roughly half of China's $5.5 trillion mobile-payments market.?But the company is eager to expand internationally amid aggressive competition in its home market from Tencent Holdings Ltd.?and the prospect of increased regulation on internet finance.?It's struck partnerships around the globe, including in India, Thailand, South Korea and France. The company didn't respond to requests for additional comment.Chinese takeovers of American companies have prompted warnings from lawmakers about risks to national security with CFIUS able to impose changes on deals to protect national security or recommend that the president block them. In September, Trump blocked the sale of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. to a buyer funded by a Chinese state-owned entity.But Ant --?which paid MoneyGram a $30 million termination fee?-- has disputed assertions that U.S. security would be compromised by the deal, citing its plans to keep the U.S. company's headquarters, management team and employees in Dallas. The company said MoneyGram's servers -- and the data stored on them -- would also remain in the U.S.??The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction,??

The daily fantasy industry, the most popular of the licit workarounds, redefined the legal line between paying contests and gambling.During Sunday's Super Bowl,?WinView is pushing those boundaries even further, offering fans the chance to win money by correctly predicting events as the game unfolds.It's similar to what's known in other parts of the world as in-game prop betting, and it's very popular among fans looking for another reason to care about the game. WinView has altered the offering a bit, creating a ??game of skill?? that it says is exempt from U.S. sports gambling prohibitions.??We call it a sports IQ prediction game,?? WinView Executive Chairman Tom Rogers said. ??We want to really separate this from what may come in terms of legalized sports betting and wagering. That's a world apart from a social game of skill.??WinView's premise is simple. Players buy into a group of up to 25 other fans for contests that last an NFL or NBA quarter. Over the course of the quarter, every contestant is given the same set of questions to answer. You can weight each answer different, but on the whole, more correct answers means more points. The players with the most points at the end of each quarter win money.This month marks WinView's first foray into for-money games. The company launched in 2014, and raised?$12 million in May from a group that includes Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis and Discovery Communications. Until two weeks ago, the company's offerings were all free to enter, with a few cash prizes done through sponsors. The new cash games, with entry fees from $2 to $100, are available in 36 states.The gradual evolution of WinView comes as many companies across tech, media and gambling brace for a change to sports betting laws in the U.S. The Supreme Court is expected to rule this spring on the constitutionality of the federal law that bars sports betting. The NBA, led by commissioner Adam Silver, has been vocal in how it would like the federal government to lay out a national framework. If the laws change one way or another, ??it'd be a good outcome,?? Rogers said.That's because WinView's 48 patents cover not only its current offerings, but also some of the live, in-game betting technology that has become popular in gambling markets across Europe. Those rights would be ??very valuable?? in a legalized system, Rogers said.For the Super Bowl, WinView is offering a promotional $25,000 jackpot, paid if any player in their cash games can correctly answer every one of the 18-25 questions posed in a quarter of the Super Bowl. The odds aren't in your favor -- guessing right on 25 straight coin flips, for example, is 1 in 33,554,432 -- but participants can still win money as part of WinView's paid games and it will likely bring more users to give it a try.

Net sales hit 45.91 billion yen, compared with the estimated 44.69 billion yen.The company established Line Financial Corp. on Jan. 10 and?has already applied for a license to open a cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, according to a statement.?Line is also considering expanding its cryptocurrency operations to Hong Kong and Luxembourg next, according to people familiar with the matter.Since Line's listing in July 2016, the company has scaled back its global ambitions to focus on markets where it already has top share -- Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. Faced with a stagnant user base, Chief Executive Officer Takeshi Idezawa has set out to transform the messaging app into an all-in-one communications and entertainment service over the next five years. He has centered it on video and everyday services powered by artificial intelligence. Adding financial offerings may help reduce the company's reliance on advertising revenue and offer a way to gain subscribers in countries dominated by Facebook?Inc.'s Messenger and WhatsApp.??We started Line messenger in 2011, in the midst of a paradigm shift brought about by smartphones,?? Idezawa said at an earnings briefing in Tokyo on Wednesday. ??We believe AI and fin-tech are poised for a similar paradigm shift this year and that's where we will focus our strategic investments.??The shares rose 2.6 percent in Tokyo before the financial results were reported, adding to gains after Bloomberg News first reported the expansion. Expenses rose in the quarter because of upfront costs for AI speakers and game marketing spending.Line will invest 30 billion yen in fin-tech and AI operations this fiscal year, Idezawa said. Starting from the current quarter, the company will break out earnings results for the two business.The company plans to provide the offerings inside its messenger app, according to the statement. Some services may be offered as a stand-alone?brand, the people said, asking not to be named because the details are private. The insurance business will focus on resale, centered?initially on the Japanese market where commissions are high, they said. Line is also considering applications of blockchain technology?in countries with underdeveloped financial infrastructure to enable services such as the such as the ability to pay utility bills via mobile phone.The company said it is stepping up hiring of specialists in financial technology and blockchain around the world. It has received hundreds of applications,?according to the people.Line has been offering a smartphone wallet service since 2014. Line Pay has 40 million registered users worldwide. Transaction volume jumped to 450 billion yen last year, bolstered by users in Taiwan who turned to the service to pay their taxes.The number of monthly active users in the core four countries remained mostly unchanged at 167.5 million users, with Japan accounting for about 40 percent. The company reported sales grew 19 percent to a record 167 billion yen last fiscal year, as ad revenue rose 40 percent in the period. Sales of digital stickers climbed 3 percent, while those of games declined 10 percent.The company, which has been offering wireless service as a mobile virtual network operator since Sept. 2016, announced a partnership with Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group Corp. Under the agreement, SoftBank will buy 51 percent of Line's MVNO unit by March to help expand operations.Line's plan to enter cryptocurrency space comes just days after a domestic exchange called Coincheck Inc. said hackers stole nearly $500 million in digital tokens. The heist?revived concerns about security?in the country where?the mainstream public was first exposed to cryptocurrencies with the robbery of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox in 2014.??We have no plans to issue Line coin or anything like that,?? Idezawa said. ??But we are looking broadly at cryptocurrencies and blockchain in our plans and discussions with potential partners. We plan to pursue a whole range of opportunities.??"

That's better than 95 percent of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Kara and his team members, Ulrik Jensen and Rasmus Quist Pedersen, use three steps in their investment process. The first is a scoring system of 20,000 lines of code that Kara programmed himself. It looks at 6,000 to 7,000 stocks globally, scoring them on about 150 metrics based on fundamentals and valuation.?What comes out on top is then culled based on the probability of accounting fraud, internal rate of return and the efficiency of the CEO.?The final step is making a decision to invest.??We combine our knowledge with the machine's knowledge,?? said Kara, who oversees $5.5 billion. ??That's a better approach than just filtering stocks using screens and just buying cheaply because we're value investors.??The fund, which started in 2005, holds 25 to 35 stocks to give it enough diversification, according to Kara, who previously worked at Danske Bank.

The number of shows released in the U.S. has more than doubled in seven years. Production of scripted shows has soared with the entry of online competitors like NetflixSource: FX NetworksSilicon Valley giants and Hollywood's biggest studios are locked in a struggle for control of the entertainment industry, with newer online players steadily gaining ground. Technology companies are investing in shows to attract customers to video services delivered over the internet, while the established media are spending more to keep viewers from abandoning their networks.Netflix Inc. has become the largest supplier of new shows, increasing output from just a few programs in 2013 to dozens in 2017 in a bid to sign up more customers. The strategy has worked, with the streaming service growing to more than 109 million subscribers and its market value touching $90 billion.Critics placed more Netflix shows on their year-end ????best of'' lists than any other network, surpassing HBO, according to a tally from FX. The service also has several movies and shows, including ??The Crown,?? competing at this weekend's Golden Globe Awards.While Netflix has attacked the business head on, attempting to build the dominant entertainment service on the internet, other technology giants have invested in video as part of broader agendas. Amazon.com Inc. releases dozens of TV shows and movies to build loyalty among its online shoppers, and Apple Inc. is funding TV to help sell mobile phones.John Landgraf, FX Networks' chief executive officer, has tracked production in recent years to call attention to what he says is an unsustainable surge in TV production, which he dubs ??peak TV.?? Networks are producing more shows than viewers have time to watch, hurting profitability.The competition has led to consolidation among pay-TV distributors and media companies. Walt Disney Co. agreed last month to acquire much of 21st Century Fox, including FX, for $52.4 billion. AT&T Inc. is trying to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion and is fighting in court with the U.S. Justice Department, which opposed the deal.Joining Disney ??will inevitably help our brand to remain competitive and relevant in the future?? Landgraf said Friday at a meeting of television critics. As unregulated Internet companies expand, media companies have no choice but to seek scale.Some TV networks have begun to trim production. The number of scripted shows released by basic cable channels declined for the second year in a row. Those networks had previously been the primary driver of growth.The success of FX's ??The Shield?? and AMC's ??Mad Men?? inspired networks like TNT, WGN America and MTV to try their hand. The number of shows released on basic cable rose more than fivefold from 2002 to 2013."

The price could reach as much as $7 billion over time if the drug reaches certain milestones.Under the agreement, Celgene will add as much as $1.25 billion to the upfront payment if Impact's drug fedratinib reaches approval milestones to treat?myelofibrosis, a form of bone marrow cancer, and another $150 million for other indications. Additional payments could reach as much as $4.5 billion if global annual sales rise above $5 billion, according to a statement Sunday.The total price would make Impact one of Celgene's biggest acquisitions ever. The drugmaker is under increasing pressure to replace revenue from its top-selling cancer treatment before copycat medicines eat into Revlimid sales. Its stock lost more than a quarter of its value during a five-day stretch in October, after a highly anticipated drug for Crohn's disease failed a late-stage trial and the drugmaker cut its 2020 profit target.The shares haven't recovered all of the lost ground, and as of Friday traded 28 percent below their 2017 peak of early October, giving Celgene a market value of about $83 billion. After news of the deal broke, shares climbed as high as $106.88 in premarket trading on Monday, and were recently up less than 1 percent at $105.80.Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in an email that the company ??wisely structured?? the deal to base much of its value on sales milestones, and isn't overpaying for a late-stage asset.The Summit, New Jersey-based company has made a series of acquisitions and signed partnerships in recent years to bring in new drug candidates. Those include ozanimod, which it gained through the $7.2 billion purchase of Receptos Inc. in 2015 and is being tested in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.Chief Executive Officer Mark Alles has pledged to look outside Celgene's own labs for new drugs to bolster its pipeline, telling investors in October that ??we look for opportunity all the time.??Impact, based in San Diego, was founded in 2016 by Chief Executive Officer John Hood and other executives. For Hood, it will be the second time he's been involved in the sale of fedratinib. He was a co-inventor of the drug while working at TargeGen Inc., according to Impact's website. French drugmaker Sanofi acquired TargeGen in 2010 for an upfront payment of $75 million.Sanofi dropped development of fedratinib in 2013 after some patients in clinical trials suffered a neurological condition known as Wernicke's encephalopathy that prompted the FDA to put the studies on hold. Impact's founders acquired the rights to the drug from Sanofi and formed the company in 2016. Impact was able to get the FDA to allow trials to proceed after showing that the rate of Wernicke's encephalopathy in the trial wasn't unusual for a patient population of that size, Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients.Besides the founders, investors in Impact include venture capital firm Medicxi. Credit Suisse Group AG and Hogan Lovells advised Celgene while Impact worked with PJT Partners Inc. and Latham & Watkins LLP.The acquisition announcement comes as JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s annual health-care investment conference, a key deal-making venue, kicks off Monday in San Francisco.??

Aircraft were held at their departure airports Sunday afternoon, and planes in the air were being diverted to other cities, the airport said.Atlanta-based Delta dropped a total of 900 mainline and regional flights because of the outage, and?as of 7:15 p.m., it had scrapped the rest on its Sunday schedule out of the city.?Georgia Power said a fire caused ??extensive damage?? in an underground facility, though no passengers or workers were in any danger.In a Sunday night press conference, Mayor Reed said the intensity of the fire damaged the switch that would have allowed the built-in backup power systems to take over.

His father, Rupert, it seemed, would have to look elsewhere for his successor.Few might have predicted that now, more than a decade later, the hopes of Rupert Murdoch -- and the future of 21st Century Fox Inc. --- would once again rest on his elder son Lachlan. Few outsiders, in fact, see a viable alternative.Today Lachlan Murdoch is the subject of more speculation in media circles than he ever was before. While his father, now 86, has groomed him for the top job, Lachlan has never independently run anything as big and complicated as what is being billed as the ??new Fox.?? He now seems all but certain to assume the helm after his brother, current Fox CEO James Murdoch, sees through a $52.4 billion asset sale to Walt Disney Co. over the next 12 to 18 months. The question -- for the global media and investors alike -- is what will happen then.??I don't see an obvious other choice,?? said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC.Even though it will be much smaller, the new Fox will still house a broadcast network, a top sports channel and a cable-news outlet that's the most watched in America -- and in the White House. He'll be responsible for maintaining Fox News's influence while smoothing its rougher edges, as he did by implementing policy changes after the sexual-harassment scandals of Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly.??It is very hard?Bloomberg's Anousha Sakoui discusses Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan and the succession plan at 21st Century Fox.to judge him because he has not made major executive decisions,???said Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis Ltd. in London. ??His capacities have not been tested as much as those of James.??To be sure, Lachlan led Fox alongside his father and brother through a tumultuous period, with new competitive threats like Netflix Inc. Just 15 months older than James, Lachlan will be the one to choose whether to take the job as CEO of the new Fox no matter his father's wishes, according to people familiar with the company's plans. He's already transplanted his family from Australia to Los Angeles, and he's unlikely to want to move them again to New York, where Fox is based.Lachlan's decision to quit as deputy chief operating officer of News Corp. in 2005 came after his father sided with Ailes and then-president Peter Chernin on programming decisions. Lachlan decamped to Australia, where he had met his wife when he ran News Corp.'s businesses there back in the '90s.He embraced his love of spearfishing and mountain climbing, bought a mansion in upscale Bellevue Hill and established Illyria, an investment fund whose successes included an investment of about $200 million in radio-station operator Nova Entertainment Group, now worth about $800 million.News Corp.'s board pushed in 2012 to sell its stake in another company Lachlan had championed, REA Group Ltd., which offers real estate listings in Australia online. He fought back and won. The value of the holding has more than tripled to $4.92 billion and now generates more than a third of News Corp.'s earnings.Lachlan remained a director of News Corp., which split from Fox in the 2013 restructuring after the British phone-hacking scandal that rocked the Murdoch empire.Persuaded by his father to return in 2014, he now shares chairman duties at both entities with Rupert. James is likely to leave Fox after the Disney deal, possibly for a position at Disney or to start his own venture.Lachlan has been playing an increasingly public role, leading earnings calls and shareholder gatherings. The London native frequently doesn't look the corporate-honcho part. In 2016, at the Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, he sported a busy beard, mirrored shades and shirts that displayed the tattoo enveloping his left forearm. At Fox's annual meeting last year, he showed up with a shaved head.People describe him as disarmingly charming and easy to talk to. After his deal for Nova, he made a point of shaking hands and welcoming more than 400 new employees, one person recalled.But executives who worked with Lachlan in Australia described him as uncomfortable with conflict.?Siobhan McKenna, managing partner of Illyria, is known to handle negotiations and execute tough decisions on his behalf, the executives said.Ten Network Holdings Ltd., the TV network he invested in and led as chairman, became a black mark for Lachlan last year when he lost a bidding war for the company to CBS Corp., costing Fox a distribution partner in Australia. The company was auctioned after Murdoch and another investor decided not to continue to back the company's credit facilities, leading the network to place itself into administration.Since his return to a senior role at Fox, Lachlan has helped steer the development of online-TV service Hulu and the expansion of Indian network Star Sports. The Disney deal has sent shares soaring to a four-year high. Since Fox is selling its television studio, Lachlan will likely be charged with developing new production capabilities and investments in original programming to continue the broadcast network's rebound after falling behind in the ratings last year.For Fox News, Lachlan may be a more sympathetic leader than James, the liberal in the Murdoch circle. Lachlan hasn't made public his views on global warming, the Trump administration or much else in the political realm. He has given money to Australia's conservative Liberal Party. But he also signed a letter with James criticizing Trump's ban on immigrants from Muslim countries, and he's led reforms at Fox News to create a more welcoming environment for women.??His father is perhaps not expecting Lachlan to do more than support him,?? Enders said. The question is whether that's enough to satisfy Lachlan.?? With assistance by David Hellier"

NJ Transit Executive Director Steve Santoro, who will leave the job in April, has told lawmakers that the agency is confident it will meet a Dec. 31 deadline to have the software in place on all 440 pieces of power equipment.Part of the program is on hold, though, according to Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, nominated to oversee transportation by Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, who took office Jan. 16. Asked in an interview whether the agency is continuing to pull locomotives and other power equipment, called cab cars, from service for software installations, she said: ??At this moment in time, no.??At a news conference earlier in New Brunswick, Gutierrez-Scaccetti also wasn't so confident in the agency's ability to make deadline on the technology, which automatically brakes trains in danger of derailing or crashing.??Nobody can say that right now,?? she said.The nation's second-biggest commuter railroad, financially starved by two-term Republican Governor Chris Christie, has the most accidents and safety fines among its peers. In December, Murphy called the agency ??a national disgrace.????This is a failure of leadership,?? Murphy told reporters at the news conference to announce Kevin Corbett, a vice president at the engineering company Aecom, as his nominee for NJ Transit executive director. ??We're here today to announce turning the page on the boss.??The new technology, called positive train control, could have saved eight passengers killed when an Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia in May 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded. Federal investigators are examining whether the system could have slowed another Amtrak train in Washington state that was traveling 80 miles per hour in a 30 mph zone before it derailed on Dec. 18, killing three.NJ Transit's latest estimated project cost is at least $320 million, a 28 percent increase over the October 2016 figure. In the U.S., the railroad ranks third from bottom on project progress among 41 passenger and freight lines, according to Federal Railroad Administration data.The other New York City-area operators -- the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North -- are more than half finished, while Amtrak, the national passenger railroad, is 96 percent complete."

In addition to this wait time, once the patches are run, they are likely to slow down processing speeds.??Cedric Thellier, chief technical officer at French cybersecurity advising firm Akerva, isolated health-care institutions, as well as industrial players, as those that may be at a greater risk. He said it may simply prove too difficult to update some operationally sensitive systems these businesses rely on.Reports emerged Tuesday that a feature used by billions of computer microprocessors had a vulnerability that hackers?could exploit to gain access to private system data. A fix could be issued, but some computers may see a performance drag. The hardware-based nature of the underlying problem also means recall and replacement is almost certainly no option.Large companies running database servers could see some of the biggest impact from any slowdowns, said Ian Batten, a computer science lecturer at the University of Birmingham.""I imagine that all over the Square Mile very subtle discussions are being held between database people, security people, compliance people and data center managers as they juggle the risk-to-performance trade-off from the patch,"" he said, referring to London's financial center.""Industries where servers need to operate continuously,"" such as those that power cloud computing, ""could feel an impact,"" said Ido Naor, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab.Amazon.com Inc., the biggest cloud-computing provider, previously said most of its affected AWS servers have already been secured. Microsoft said the majority of its Azure cloud infrastructure has been updated with the fix and most customers won't see a noticeable slowdown with the update.While Intel has said there are no known incidents of this vulnerability being exploited so far, the company also said it may take weeks to fully protect systems running on its chips, and estimates of the degree of slowdowns the fixes may cause are based on simulations.Peter Zaitsev, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Percona, a Raleigh, North Carolina-based company that helps businesses set and manage large computer databases, said that firms running such databases might see a 10 to 20 percent slowdown in performance from the patches being issued. He said this was not enough to cause major disruptions for most applications. He also said that subsequent versions of the patch would likely further reduce any performance impacts.He also said that in cases where a company has a server completely dedicated to a single application there was likely no need to implement the patch as these machines are not susceptible to the attacks researchers have discovered.Still, computers used by institutions like the U.K.'s National Health Service are already slow compared with the newest machines today. ??Add to that an incremental slowdown,?? Menting said, referring to the proposed software patches, ??and we're looking at a significant reduction in productivity.????We are aware of this issue and are continuing to work with stakeholders to ensure the risk is minimized,"" said an NHS spokesman. ""There is no evidence to suggest this vulnerability has been exploited across health. We are constantly monitoring and continue to work closely with NCSC.??Cybercriminals are likely to?already be looking for ways to exploit the vulnerabilities, aware that not everyone will install the patches, said Naor.Google said in a blog post that it privately informed Intel, ARM Holdings Plc and AMD of these issues on June 1 last year to give them time to find remedies before the vulnerabilities became public. While the companies were working on fixes, the same vulnerabilities were independently discovered by a team of researchers affiliated with several academic institutions and computer-security firms.Intel, responding to the reports, said the chip weakness doesn't mean hackers could corrupt, modify or delete data, and the current solutions to the vulnerability ??provide the best possible security for its customers.?? There should be no impact on the company's business, and performance slowdowns ??should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,?? the company said Wednesday.Still, investor concern has put pressure on the stock. Intel shares dropped 2.2 percent to $44.25 at 1:10 p.m. in New York, after declining 3.4 percent on Wednesday.??This is a big blow for Intel,?? Menting said. ??AMD and ARM have been better with their responses, even if they are trying to allay fears of how long their products will remain vulnerable.??The company's server chips have more than 99 percent market share. Those computers are at the heart of networks and are vital to the functioning of the internet and corporations. ?? With assistance by Ania Nussbaum"
Stranded Russian Jets in Mexican Hangars Haunt Troubled Airline,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-12/stranded-russian-jets-in-mexican-hangars-haunt-troubled-airline,"January 12, 2018, 5:00 AM EST",technology,"""Four of Interjet's 22 Superjet 100s are being cannibalized"", ""Offering freebies, competing with budget carriers takes toll""","In cavernous jet hangars in and around Mexico City, Interjet has a secret.Four of the Mexican airline's Sukhoi Superjet 100s -- out of a fleet of 22 -- have been grounded for at least five months because of engine maintenance delays. The Russian-made aircraft, which average just four years old, are now being cannibalized, an industry term for when a plane is slowly scrapped for parts to keep other jets running.A grounded plane is a wasted plane, and Interjet's offline aircraft are symbolic of an airline that's veered off course. Once one of Mexico's hopefuls to bring a new era of competition to the industry, Interjet has muddled along with a questionable strategy while more nimble rivals have appeared on the scene. Now, the stranded Sukhoi Superjets are adding to concerns about whether ABC Aerolineas, the company's formal name, will ever thrive.Active Interjet airplanes sit on the tarmac at Mexico City International Airport.??There are doubts about the viability of the business,?? says Carlos Ozores, an air-transport specialist at ICF, a consulting and technology services company based in Virginia. ??The only way for an airline to make money is to keep flying.??Interjet confirmed the grounded aircraft but said it's in good financial shape. The parked-plane situation can be traced back to a decision?Chief Executive Officer Jose Luis Garza made half a decade ago when he agreed to buy the little-known and largely untested Sukhoi Superjets,?which are backed by Italy's Leonardo SpA and Russia's Sukhoi. The engines are made by France's Safran SA and a Russian partner.JSC Sukhoi doesn't have a single maintenance facility in the Americas. Airbus SE, which services the rest of Interjet's fleet, operates three. That's important because planes need regular and meticulous upkeep. It's like driving a Hummer in a land of Volkswagens. For a time you'll be fine, but once the vehicle requires so much as a tune-up, finding the parts and the labor to fix it will be both tricky and costly.??The supply chain with this aircraft has been a process,?? Garza?says from his office overlooking the?Mexico City airport. ??But we're getting to where we want to be with them.?? To ease maintenance problems, a $7 million consignment stock is being set up this year with Sukhoi parts, he said.???The decision to buy them was a technical and economical one,?? he says, calling the deal an ??extraordinary acquisition agreement?? the company wouldn't have gotten from Brazilian maker Embraer SA.Interjet made a splash as Mexico's first airline for the budget-conscious flyer when it was founded in 2005 by the Aleman family, the son and grandson of a former president. The company's regional focus and deeply discounted ticket prices quickly turned it into the No. 2 airline by passengers as of 2011. But in the years that followed, the carrier hit turbulent skies, causing the company's overall market share to stagnate while ultra-low-cost rival Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, known as Volaris, has seen its stake soar.Interjet&apos;s market share has stagnated as competitor Volaris has captured more passengersSource: Mexico&apos;s Ministry of Communications and Transportation data??It'll be hard for it to survive without a change of strategy,?? Ozores says. ??It's hard operating in the middle.??The middle that Ozores is referring to is the point between low-cost carrier and a full-service one. Interjet's original economic model has slowly morphed into a sort of hybrid, so that these days, the carrier is trying to compete on price and service -- and falling short on both fronts.Garza says Interjet has focused its growth strategy on international routes since 2014, almost doubling its share of foreign flights to and from Mexico to about 21 percent as of November from 11 percent in 2014.While that's helped boost the company's dollar income -- a boon for companies battered by a local currency that's lost a third of its value in five years -- Interjet has paid a heavy price to compete with its bigger rivals.?Interjet freebies likes snacks and checked luggage put its costs on par with full-service rivals like Grupo Aeromexico SAB. It also boasts of comfy leg room, adapting the seating configuration on its Airbus aircraft so that its planes fly an average 13 percent below capacity. Despite those perks, Interjet's image is still solidly stuck in the domain of budget carriers. But its prices are sometimes more than double those of Volaris, which started operations in 2006.??We're told we're leaving money on the table,?? Garza says. ??Does that mean we should overbook flights and start charging for everything? We don't think so.??Jose Luis GarzaMeanwhile, Interjet's leverage -- Bloomberg estimates net debt is 7.1 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amotization and rent -- tops Aeromexico's ratio of 5.1 or Volaris's 5.2 times. Says Michael Duff, director at data researcher The Airline Analyst: ??A relatively high financial risk is how I'd categorize them.??It's for that reason that keeping a constant eye on costs is so crucial. For low-cost carriers, that usually means limiting fleets to a single aircraft to save on maintenance-training costs. But Interjet's 22 Superjet 100 planes?coexist with its 50 Airbus A320 jetliners as well as six Airbus A321 aircraft.??The most important defining characteristic of a low-cost carrier is an airline that's able to keep costs low, whatever way they manage to do it,?? says Triant Flouris, an International Air Transport Association flight instructor and academic at the Hellenic American University in Greece.Interjet&apos;s costs are closer to those of Aeromexico than fellow low-cost carrier VolarisSource: Total operating costs per available seat kilometer as compiled by The Airline AnalystIt was about a year ago that CEO Garza's decision to bet on the Sukhoi Superjet first came back to haunt him in a big way. In December 2016 -- peak travel season for holiday flyers -- the Russian aviation authority warned of a defect in a part that helps the aircraft fly straight in the air. After Interjet inspected its own planes, it grounded half its Sukhoi Superjet fleet and was forced to cancel 25 flights, Garza said at the time.Although the planes were back in service by the following month, the damage was done.?Some consumers began a social media campaign to pressure Mexico's consumer watchdog to ban Interjet from flying the planes ever again, although nothing came of the requests.??The Superjet hasn't become very popular outside of Russia,?? Flouris says. ??Most of the airlines that I've seen flying this jet are closer to Russia.??The 2012 Sukhoi Superjet purchase was the best choice for Interjet given Mexico City's temperatures, altitudes and the routes they were intended to cover, CEO Garza says. It was a bold bet on Russia's first major passenger aircraft since the collapse of the Soviet Union.The single-aisle aircraft sold for about a half of the price of comparable jets from Brazil's Embraer or Canada's Bombardier Inc. During a promotional flight in May 2012 -- just three months before Interjet exercised an option to buy more planes -- one of the first Sukhoi Superjets ever produced crashed into a mountain in Indonesia, killing all 45 aboard. Indonesian investigators said human error was the most likely cause.JSC Sukhoi did not respond to requests for comment.Today, Interjet is JSC Sukhoi's second-biggest customer -- behind only Russian Airlines PJSC, known as Aeroflot. Interjet board Chairman Miguel Aleman Velasco said at an October event that the company is even considering adding to its Russian-made fleet with the purchase of JSC Sukhoi's twin-engine MS-21s when they roll out in 2019.Interjet has some financial challenges to overcome in the meantime. Financial reports show maintenance costs are rising faster than other expenses, and they now top what Aeromexico pays to keep its planes running, Duff says. Aircraft-leasing firms have boosted deposit requirements for the airline, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson says, adding that ??lessors are probably paying close attention to their operations.?? Out of its 78-aircraft fleet, the company owns 30 and leases the rest.A 3.2 billion-peso cash injection put forth by the Aleman family last year helped the company pay down most of its short-term liabilities. The company's financial debt of about 12.4 billion pesos is made up of 800 million pesos in Cebures -- a type of domestic bond -- and bank loans in dollars with an average maturity of four years, Chief Financial Officer Raul Lopez says.??We paid down short-term debt because that's what had analysts worried,?? Garza says.Mexico's government has reason to be worried, too. The nation took a major blow when Mexicana de Aviacion SA filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in 2010. Mexicana's chairman was charged with alleged embezzlement (the charges were later dropped), and hundreds of pilots and flight attendants saw large chunks of their pension funds shrink. Mexico's aviation market, meanwhile, lost one of its biggest players, opening the void that Interjet, Volaris and Aeromexico would ultimately fill.The Aleman family has flirted with the idea of taking the company public for several years. In 2011, an IPO was scrapped at the last minute after a slumping Mexican market and higher fuel costs weakened investor demand. In 2013, Chairman Aleman Velasco said the company,?which holds valuable takeoff and landing rights at Mexico City's crowded airport, planned to raise as much as $1 billion with a stake sale of up to 25 percent.The carrier last year sought to sell an equity stake to a foreign airline such as American Airlines Group Inc. or United Continental Holdings Inc., Aleman Velasco told Bloomberg in an interview in late 2016. No announcement was ever made.Both options -- an equity stake first, then an IPO -- are still on the table and expected by the end of this year or next, Garza says.??The family is going to put as much money into it as they need to keep the lessors financing it,?? Ferguson says. ??At the end of the day, family money is patient.??"

Roku is also licensing its technology to other companies so they can make audio devices that work on its operating system, expanding on an existing program for TVs.The two new offerings will bring another collection of listening devices into people's homes. For example, users will be able to say, ??Hey Roku, play jazz in the living room?? and an internet-connected speaker powered by Roku software will begin playing music, even if the TV is off.While Roku is using its early start in video streaming to expand into new digital home experiences, the move means more competition with Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Amazon. Those technology giants offer video-streaming devices, voice assistants and smart speakers. Roku didn't say if it will build its own Roku-branded speaker, beyond reference designs it plans to share with other hardware makers.Roku's shares have more than tripled since going public in September. It beat analysts' sales projections in its first quarterly report, posting rising advertising revenue and active user numbers. More than half of Roku's revenue comes from sales of its devices, though the company has been generating more from advertising and taking a cut of subscriptions for video streamed through its service. Roku said Wednesday it doesn't expect licensing revenue from smart speakers to be material in the foreseeable future.?? With assistance by Mark Gurman"

Intel Confronts Potential ??PR Nightmare' With Reported Chip Flaw,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-03/amd-soars-after-rival-intel-said-to-reveal-processor-flaw,"January 3, 2018, 7:37 AM EST",technology,"""‘This is a black eye for Intel,' benefit for AMD, analyst says"", ""The Register reported chips could be vulnerable to hackers""","A report that Intel Corp. chips are vulnerable to hackers raised concerns about the company's main products and brand.On Tuesday, the?technology website The Register said a bug lets some software gain access to parts of a computer's memory that are set aside to protect things like passwords. All computers with Intel chips from the past 10 years appear to be affected, the report said, and patches to Microsoft Corp.'s Windows and Apple Inc.'s OS X operating systems will be required. The security updates may slow down older machinery by as much as 30 percent, according to The Register.Flaws in the designs of microprocessors, which go through rigorous testing and verification, are usually easily fixed by patches in the code that they use to communicate with the rest of the computer. But if the error can't be fixed easily in software, it could be necessary to redesign the chip, which can be extremely costly and time consuming.Intel is expected to release a statement, but hasn't yet commented on the issue. Historically, the way companies respond to such issues and how quickly they address them has determined how big the problem becomes.??This is a potential PR nightmare,?? said Dan Ives, head of tech research at GBH Insights. ??They need to get ahead of this and try to contain any of the damage to customers as well to the brand.??The report hit Intel shares, which fell as much as 5.5 percent, the steepest drop since October 2016. It gave a boost to rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which surged as much as 8.8 percent, and Nvidia Corp., which jumped 6.3 percent.The vulnerability may have consequences beyond just computers, and may not be the result of a design or testing error. All modern microprocessors, including those that run smartphones, are built to essentially guess what functions they're likely to be asked to run next. By queuing up possible executions in advance, they're able to crunch data and run software much faster.The problem in this case, according to people familiar with the issue, is that this predictive loading of instructions allows access to data that's normally cordoned off?securely. That means, in theory, that malicious code could find a way to access information that would otherwise be out of reach, such as passwords.Chip design flaws are exceedingly rare. More than 20 years ago, a college professor discovered a problem with how early versions of Intel's Pentium chip calculated numbers. Rival International Business Machines Corp. was able to make use of the finding and claim Intel products would cause frequent problems for consumers' computers. While that didn't happen, Intel had to recall some chips and took a charge of more than $400 million.Intel's microprocessors are the fundamental building block of the internet, corporate networks and PCs. The company has added to its designs over the years trying to make computers less vulnerable to attack, arguing that hardware security is typically tougher to crack than software.The Santa Clara, California-based company's chips have more than 80 percent market share in PCs overall and more than 90 percent in laptops and servers.Programmers have been working for two months to try to provide a software patch that addresses the issue, The Register said, adding that Microsoft was expected to release a fix soon."

Chris Murray, an AltaCorp Capital Corp. analyst in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. ??One of the things that is super critical to the entire recovery plan is that the 7000 hits entry into service flawlessly.??The Global 7000's flexible wings, spanning 104 feet, will give passengers a smoother ride than competing aircraft, according to Bombardier. A top speed just under supersonic matches the fastest aircraft in the industry. The key selling point: a spacious cabin with four separate areas to hold meetings or take a nap.The Bombardier Global 7000 business jet.??We already have people asking about the 7000,?? said Pat Gallagher, sales chief for NetJets Inc., Warren Buffett's private jet company, which has ordered an undisclosed number of the planes. ??It's bigger than anything else that's out there. It will be the new flagship for Bombardier, for NetJets and for the industry in general.??The success of the Global 7000 may depend in part on how Gulfstream reacts to its first competitor in the ultra-long-range market that it created with the G650.?The planemaker isn't likely to give up its premier spot without a fight.??I certainly wouldn't want to relinquish any control of the market that I believe we built,???Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. President Mark Burns said in an interview during the largest gathering of private-jet makers in Las Vegas in October. ??That's something we have to be mindful of.??Gulfstream bet early that the wealthy were willing to pay for the kind of features offered by the G650. The wager has paid off with more than 260 deliveries of the $69 million plane since its December 2012 debut. The G650 continues to set speed records, clocking a Tokyo-New York trip in less than 11 hours.?The combination of speed and distance sells, said Burns, who calls his plane ??unmatched.?? The extended-range version of the G650 can fly 7,500 nautical miles, edging out the Global 7000 by 100 nautical miles.Gulfstream delivers about 60 G650s a year, accounting for about half of segment sales, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates. The model has helped make Gulfstream the most profitable private jet maker, with operating profit margins of 21 percent.?Bombardier's business aircraft unit, with profit margins of 8.5 percent, has a long way to go to catch Gulfstream. Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare will rely on the Global 7000 to help keep his promise to boost annual revenue to more than $20 billion by 2020. The planemaker said it has invested $1 billion this year alone in developing and producing the aircraft, with total cost of the project amounting to ??a few billion dollars,?? Bellemare said in an interview Thursday in New York.Of the expected $3.5 billion increase in annual revenue at Bombardier's Business Aircraft unit by 2020, the Global 7000 alone will probably contribute about $3 billion, Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert said Thursday in the same interview.???This is going to be a very solid return program,'' Di Bert said of the Global 7000. ??It's going to create significant value for shareholders. It's going to be around for a long time.??Bombardier's plan to ramp up production of the Global 7000 to as many as 45 planes a year after it enters service could pose a threat to G650's production levels and profit margin, JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a Dec. 12 note. The 7000 is already building a fan base.NetJets, which operates a fleet of 725 private jets, is attracted to the Global 7000's more efficient General Electric Co. engines, which promise to keep operating costs at the same level or better than Bombardier's smaller plane, the Global 6000. Bombardier is expected to begin flights of its fifth 7000 test plane within weeks, complete with a fully furnished interior, said Gallagher, the NetJet sales chief, who has toured the aircraft's assembly line.VistaJet customers who fly long distances are eager for the aircraft to begin service, said Ron Silverman, U.S. president for the Malta-based private jet charter company. VistaJet's founder Thomas Flohr has ??multiple?? Global 7000s on order and VistaJet has an option to incorporate those planes in its fleet, Silverman said.??As the routes become longer, people are looking for more comfort in the cabin,?? Silverman said. ??The Global 7000 brings that level of comfort.??"

Margalit said Wednesday at the Cybertech conference in Tel Aviv. ??It's the alliance of the moderates.??Margalit, who served on the parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee, said that a year ago, hackers likely financed by Iran used a computer virus to infiltrate a ThyssenKrupp shipyard to steal blueprints of submarines being built for Israel. He also said Iranian Revolutionary Guard strike groups try to hit Israeli nuclear researchers and civilian infrastructure almost every day.Attacks aren't just against Israel.

In 2016, a cyber strike disabled thousands of government computers in Saudi Arabia.There's already some under-the-radar cooperation on a civilian level between Israel and Arab nations, Margalit said.

Richelieu Dennis thinks Essence -- the 47-year-old magazine for black women -- is an exception.The Liberian native, chief executive officer of the hair- and skin-care maker Sundial Brands, leads a group that bought the magazine and related assets from Time Inc., making Essence a black-owned company once again after almost two decades as part of the publishing giant.As Sundial CEO, Dennis built a $240 million-a-year business catering to black women with products like SheaMoisture, Nubian Heritage and Madam C.J. Walker. The company, backed by Bain Capital, agreed to be bought by Unilever in November for undisclosed terms. Dennis, who will lead Essence with longtime President Michelle Ebanks, sees similarities between the businesses -- like their loyal customers.Richelieu Dennis??There's something about Essence that we more than like, that we really love,?? Dennis, 48, said in an interview. ??The history of the community, the forward-thinking leadership. This is about serving women of color deeply.??Essence, which began publishing in 1970, has done a good job keeping subscribers over the past decade, especially as periodicals have lost readers and advertisers to online media. Monthly circulation of the fashion, beauty and culture publication tops 1 million, down just 2.6 percent from 2007, and the company reaches about 16 million people through digital, video and social media, including TV specials like ??Black Women in Hollywood Awards on OWN.???Monthly circulation at the magazine for black women has stabilized over the past decade Source: Alliance for Audited MediaEbony Magazine, owned by Clear View Group, is down about 9 percent over roughly that stretch, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.The company also owns the annual Essence Festival, which attracts about a half million people to New Orleans each July for music and food. Tickets start at $159, and in 2015 Time's CEO told the Wall Street Journal it earned more money than the magazine made in a year.Dennis,?who started in business by carrying on his grandmother's enterprise of making handmade shea butter soaps and co-founded Sundial in 1992 after graduating college, sees empowerment as a theme that can advance all of Essence's operations.As part of that agenda, the magazine's all-black, all-female management team will have an equity stake. Dennis is also backing an initiative to finance women of color entrepreneurs nationwide. He plans to support crowdfunding campaigns and grant program winners up to $50,000 to pursue their business goals.He'll have some hurdles to clear. With readership down, magazine industry ad sales have plummeted in recent years and are expected to drop another 16 percent in 2018,?according to Magna Global. That's led some publishers to sell unwanted titles and to even bigger deals, like Meredith Corp.'s deal to buy Time for $1.8 billion in cash. Dennis declined to discuss ad sales and said the company's multiple businesses represent an opportunity to ??grow beyond traditional revenue streams.????Like a number of publications, Essence is going to face that hardship of re-securing its audience,?? said Meredith Clark, an assistant professor of media at the University of Virginia. ??That's a real-high maintenance relationship.??So far, advertisers are supportive. Large marketers, including McDonald's Inc., continue to place full-page ads in the magazine, and the company is still seen as a crucial tool for reaching black consumers.??It is one of the most recognized brands in the U.S.,?? said Rebecca Brown, vice president of marketing at E.T. Browne Drug Co., maker of Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula. The company, known for its lotion products, has been advertising in Essence for more than 35 years.That type of loyalty gives Essence good odds for success, according to Tamara Jeffries, former executive editor who wrote a cover story on Oprah Winfrey last year and is now an associate professor of journalism at Bennett College.?On Twitter, some users reacted to the magazine's new black ownership by making pledges to renew their subscriptions and posting clapping hands emojis.??It's hard to explain how powerful and how close-knit that community of black women is,??

Now, with a one-two punch of heavy snow and bone-rattling cold on the way, grid operators say this: We're good.??Everything looks to be on track to remain reliable,?? Chris Pilong, director of dispatch for PJM Interconnection LLC, which stretches from Illinois to Washington D.C., said on a conference call Wednesday.???Maybe Sunday and into Monday of next week, we should get ourselves back to at least the freezing mark.??Some Midwest gas plants have reported trouble getting supplies for the second day in a row, forcing outages and increased use of fuel oil, according to Derek Wingfield, a spokesman for Southwest Power Pool Inc. ??All things considered, though, we've not experienced any operational issues that we've been unable to mitigate.??Bloomberg New Energy Finance's Shunondo Basu reports on record natural gas demand during this cold snap.It's a similar story for Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc., which spans part of central Canada and down to the Gulf Coast. While some plants have failed to run because of pipeline constraints, the ??outages have been captured and accounted for in real time operations,?? Mark Brown, a spokesman for the grid manager, said by email.In New England, which will probably face the brunt of the winter storm currently barreling up the Atlantic coast, there should be enough fuel at power plants to make it through the weekend without major problems, said Marcia Blomberg, a spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc.While there are concerns about oil supplies and restrictions governing air emissions this winter, Blomberg said, ??through this weekend, we expect to have sufficient capacity and fuel available to meet demand, and emissions limitations are not expected to be a significant factor.??Oil, a scant contributor to the nation's power supply in normal weather conditions, has accounted for about 30 percent of New England's electricity in recent days after temperatures plunged below freezing. A lack of pipeline capacity has constrained gas supplies to the region in recent years, causing prices to surge during severe cold snaps.?In New York, where dual-fuel power plants have also turned increasingly to oil this week, there should be enough supplies to get through the coming storms, said David Flanagan, a spokesman for the New York Independent System Operator.Across the PJM region, the load exceeded 136,000 megawatts in the hour ending at 8 a.m., the highest since February 2015.PJM is preparing for problems that may result from the storm's combination of snow, ice and strong winds forecast to hit Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. Then, with temperatures plunging again in the storm's wake, power demand by Friday morning will probably return to the multi-year highs that came on Wednesday morning, Pilong said on Wednesday's conference call.This week, PJM has operated with as much as 19,000 megawatts of outages, mostly due to mechanical failures -- though a small portion of that resulted from plants having trouble procuring gas. PJM still has more than 25,000 megawatts of reserve margin, Pilong said. ??From a generator performance perspective, we've seen very consistent performance this entire week.??One company that operates in the Midwest, American Electric Power Co., has experienced ??a few intermittent?? issues at power plants, including with gas supplies, but the problems have been resolved, spokeswoman Melissa McHenry said by email.??So far, the weather is not creating significant issues for our generating units,??

Despite recent speculation that Uber may withdraw from the region after SoftBank Group Corp.'s investment in the company, he said that's simply not the plan.Brooks Entwistle??I have been given absolute instructions to run and grow the business,?? said the 50-year-old, who was previously chairman for Southeast Asia at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ??That's what I'm doing, and that's what I'm going to do.''Japan will be a major focus for Uber in 2018, he said. It's one of the largest taxi markets in the world and one Uber has so far failed to crack. Entwistle said Uber is in early talks with several taxi companies in the country, and he expects to strike more than one partnership there. The U.S. company is also in discussions with payments firms across Asia to ink partnerships similar to its tie-up with Vietnamese mobile wallet company MoMo.The 'Taxi Prince' Fighting to Make Sure Uber Won't Win in JapanThe moves may create tension with SoftBank. The Japanese company just took a 15 percent stake in Uber and wants it to pull out of certain Asian markets, according to people familiar with the matter. In Southeast Asia, for example, Uber competes against Grab, whose largest shareholder is none other than SoftBank. An Uber withdrawal would save money for both startups, and would improve the U.S. company's profitability ahead of its planned initial public offering in 2019.Grab, led by co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan, has already begun preliminary talks to acquire Uber operations and wants a deal, said the people, asking not to be named because the matter is private.There's a similar situation in India. Uber competes in the country against Ola, which is the leading local player and also backed by SoftBank. Uber and Ola have also begun talks about a deal, according to one of people. A merger in India may face opposition from regulators however, given a lack of viable rivals in ride-hailing.A spokesman for Uber declined to comment on any speculation about negotiations with Grab or Ola. Entwistle said there are no talks that he knew of.?For Uber, the trade-off is scale. If it pulls out of markets like India and Indonesia, that will improve profitability immediately -- but it would sacrifice long-term growth. Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said recently the company would continue to be aggressive about expansion in 2018 as he sees Uber as being ??everywhere for everyone.????One of the fundamental strengths of Uber is a global scope that we have,?? he said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ??I would look at Uber very much as a global brand.??He declined to comment directly on SoftBank's influence or potential deals. The Japanese company only has two board seats at Uber and lacks the control to force any agreements.??SoftBank is a very important shareholder, and many of our shareholders have opinions over what's the right thing to do,?? Khosrowshahi said in Davos. ??We will have discussions at the board, and we will set a long-term strategy and execute.??Inside Masayoshi Son's Eccentric, Relentless Deal-Making SpreeKhosrowshahi has scheduled his first visit to Asia since taking over as CEO last summer. He will visit Japan and India this month to meet business and government leaders.Brooks EntwistleSince joining Uber, Entwistle has been working to make parts of Asia into a model of the cooperative, law-abiding company that his boss wants to build. From Bangkok to Taipei, he's inked several partnerships with taxi companies, once its sworn enemies. Uber has come under investigation from the U.S. Justice Department for possible violations of laws against overseas bribery and has been sued by a woman whose Uber driver was convicted of rape in an Indian court.Entwistle is from Colorado and a serious mountain climber. He likened his job at Uber now to climbing Everest last year. His team reached the summit in 27 days, compared to the 60 days it typically takes.??What I've learned in the Himalayas is that you want to have diversions to an absolute minimum and keep focused on the task at hand,?? he said. ??I'm bringing in that learning, and we're putting everything we have into this Asia Pacific market.????

The group has several bonds and loans from multiple banks maturing at similar times, causing a ??temporary liquidity?? issue, Citic Bank said.A more than $40 billion acquisition spree since 2016 that was fueled by debt and included stakes in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG has landed HNA in the spotlight of regulators and investors around the world.

"A Breakthrough Blindness Treatment Will Cost $425,000 Per Eye, If It Works",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-03/biotech-to-charge-850-000-for-blindness-treatment-if-it-works,"January 3, 2018, 8:30 AM EST",technology,"""Spark Therapeutics proposes installment payments and rebates"", ""Novel approach will tie cost of medicine to patients' benefit""","A transformative genetic treatment for a rare, inherited form of blindness will come with a price tag of of $425,000 per eye, or $850,000 for both, said Spark Therapeutics Inc., the tiny biotechnology company that is bringing the therapy to market.Since Spark's Luxturna was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month, speculation over the price has grown as it became clear the therapy would be one of the first in a wave of medicines that yield remarkable results after a single treatment -- and would carry a commensurate cost.In a novel arrangement, Spark will offer discounts based on whether or not the drug works initially and remains effective for the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 patients in the U.S. with a type of inherited retinal disease caused by a mutant gene.??We believe that this price reflects not only the breakthrough, life-altering value of one-time Luxturna, but it will enable us to continue to invest and build on the revolutionary science that supports not only Luxturna but the rest of our pipeline,?? Chief Executive Officer Jeff Marrazzo said in a phone interview.Spark shares rose 1 percent to $53.85 at 9:33 a.m. in New York. The company's effectiveness-based discount is sharply different from how most drugs are currently sold. Health insurers are also used to paying for medicine over the course of a disease or over a patient's life, in the case of some chronic conditions.A one-time treatment presented a challenge, since the cost would be paid for by one insurer or government, only to have others reap the benefits when the patient changes coverage.To help mitigate that dynamic, Spark is rolling out several programs to spread out the cost over the years or give rebates to payers if the benefits wane with time.For example, the company said it's discussing a program with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that would spread payments for Luxturna over several years, even though the therapy would be given only once. It didn't say how many installments would be made, or how long it would take to pay the full cost of the drug.In an agreement with the Boston-area insurer Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Spark will get the full price of treatment up front. If patients don't get an immediate benefit -- measured at 30 days, or a long term one -- measured at 30 months, Spark will have to give some of the money back in a rebate.Spark has also proposed selling the gene therapy directly to insurance companies or specialty pharmacies. That would sidestep the current process that requires hospitals or health care providers to buy expensive therapies upfront. Spark is working with Express Scripts Holding Co. on such an arrangement, and said it's talking with other drug plans.Express Scripts has been a frequent critic of costly drugs, yet said that the Spark treatment is an exception.""Many people were anticipating this would be more than a million dollars"" said Steve Miller, the St. Louis-based company's chief medical officer. ??In the end, this is a revolutionary product, and I think in most plans this will be covered.??Spark's biggest challenge may be finding patients to treat.Of the few thousand people with the disease, only a few have actually been tested and confirmed to have it, since there was no cure, and thus little use in diagnosis.

The nation's growth rate has risen close to 5 percent last year after completing a $6.6 billion?International Monetary Fund loan program that staved off a balance-of-payment crisis in 2013. However, Pakistan's current account deficit is widening and foreign-exchange reserves dwindling as exports lag regional peers, prompting speculation that the government may need IMF support again.Nonetheless, cellular phone penetration stands at around 71 percent in the country of more than 200 million people, according to Pakistan's telecommunication authority. ??The number of smartphones are growing, Internet users are growing,??

How Snapchat Is Helping One Doctor Transform Medical Training,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-21/digital-eyewear-3d-holograms-challenge-hidebound-med-schools,"January 21, 2018, 4:00 PM EST",technology,"""Technology may help scale up doctor-training, easing shortage"", ""Digital health market seen reaching $537 billion by 2025""","Shafi Ahmed dons a pair of digital sunglasses and explains how the tiny lenses built into its black plastic frame, which can capture high-resolution images, are transforming how doctors get trained in operating rooms.The British colorectal surgeon used Snap Inc.'s high-tech spectacles a year ago to walk rookie physicians and millions of curious viewers through a hernia operation using the Snapchat photo-sharing app. In 2018, he plans to beam his avatar into operating rooms with so-called immersive technology, which spans everything from military training to adult entertainment, and promises to support the next generation of doctors with real-time supervision and tutelage.??Doctors do not need to feel out of their depth, and this technology will allow them to get help whenever required,?? says Ahmed, whose early adoption of digital technology and social media has seen him recognized as the planet's most-watched surgeon, with more than 2 million views and 50 million Twitter posts for the Snapchat surgery alone. ??We all need support and help when faced with a tricky situation.??Ahmed's well-publicized, public approach rankles some members of a very conservative profession. Yet he says it represents one of the best ways to meet the World Health Organization's call to ??scale up transformative, high-quality education?? and plug a predicted global shortfall of 15 million health workers by 2030.A report by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery estimated in 2015 that 5 billion people lack access to safe, affordable surgical and anesthesia care, leading to about 17 million deaths annually. Saving lives will require a doubling of the surgical workforce, or an extra 2.2 million surgeons, anesthetists and obstetricians over 15 years, the report said.??It's not just that we have a shortage of health professionals, we also, as a consequence, have a shortage of teachers,?? said Josip Car, an associate professor of health services outcomes research at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.Car is working in collaboration with the WHO on the world's largest systematic review of evidence on the effectiveness of digital learning. It's a field, he says, that is attracting ??great interest,?? but which requires careful evaluation.??The evidence appears to suggest that, on the whole, these technologies are likely to be equivalent to traditional modes of education,?? Car said in a telephone interview. ??If this turns out to be so, that's very good news because many of them allow scalability and flexibility of learning.??Already, technological innovations are increasing the automation of diagnoses and personalized treatments, and medical schools are incorporating them into their teaching. For example, California's Stanford Medicine is combining imaging from MRIs, CT scans and angiograms with a new software system to create a three-dimensional model that physicians and patients can see and manipulate.??Medical education is ripe for disruption,?? said Marc M. Triola, associate dean for educational informatics at NYU Langone Health in New York. ??Cutting-edge technologies such as virtual and augmented reality may quickly become standard-of-care and mainstream.??Ahmed used Microsoft Corp.'s HoloLens headsets to virtually bring together surgeons from the BMI London Independent Hospital and Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai to operate together on a bowel-cancer patient in October. Each colleague was able to view tumor scans that appeared as 3D holograms, and could ??see?? each other as graphic avatars, standing and speaking as if together in the operating room at the Royal London Hospital.??My story is about connecting people globally,?? Ahmed, 48, said in his office at the London Independent Hospital. An associate dean of Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, the Bangladesh-born surgeon performed the world's first virtual reality operation recorded and streamed live in 360-degree, or immersive, video in 2016.It was viewed live by 55,000 people in 142 countries and downloaded 200,000 times on YouTube, he said. Ahmed co-founded Medical Realities Ltd., which began last April offering a free virtual reality interactive learning module for surgical trainees.While virtual reality isn't new in health-care, its affordability is: Medical headsets have traditionally cost from $30,000 to $300,000, according to a World Economic Forum report on emerging technologies. Facebook Inc.'s Oculus Go wireless headset, meant to be the company's most accessible VR device, will cost $199 when it's released in early 2018.Shafi Ahmed wears the Microsoft HoloLens inside his operating theater.That's helping to stoke a market for virtual reality hardware and software that's poised to expand 54 percent annually over the next five years, reaching almost $27 billion by 2022,?Sarasota, Florida-based Zion Market Research said in a report in October.The global digital health market, which includes everything from fitness apps and wearable devices to consultations over the Internet, will reach $537 billion by 2025 from $196 billion in 2017, Transparency Market Research said in September. Philips Healthcare, McKesson Corp., Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc., Cerner Corp., and Agfa-Gevaert N.V. are among companies benefiting from the growth,?the Albany, New York-based firm said.Continuous innovations are needed to meet the changing demands and future challenges of medicine, said Luke Slawomirski, a health economist and policy analyst with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris.??The skills and attributes needed by health-care providers will be very different in the future,?? said Slawomirski, who trained as a doctor. ??Soft skills like communication, teamwork and adaptability to complex environments will be essential. The days of the hero physician are over: Health care is now all about teamwork, relationships and trust.??Watching operations online won't provide essential surgical training, and nothing can replace the experience of interacting with real patients, said John Quinn, a vascular surgeon in Brisbane, Australia, and the executive director of surgical affairs with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.??Just watching a picture of something being done doesn't teach you terribly much,?? said Quinn, who completed his surgical training in the early 1980s. ??You have got to be able to touch and feel and do all sorts of other things.??The?Australasian College isn't in favor of live-streaming surgeries because of privacy concerns and the potential to distract and pressure the surgeon, he said.??It's treating surgery more as entertainment,?? Quinn said. ??It's almost voyeuristic and putting people's privacy greatly at risk, while they are showing things around the world to all sorts of people.??Ahmed says that, beside the training function of his online operations, engaging with and educating the public helps to demystify surgery and make it more transparent.??We have to challenge dogma and tradition in health,?? said Ahmed, who won a national training award in 2015 and is on the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. ??Unless you challenge, you will settle with mediocrity, stuck in the Dark Ages.????

Of 2,468 in-line stores that closed in 2017 -- a category that excludes department stores -- 979 weren't announced, the report produced by the firm's advisory and consulting group shows.??When leases expire, they just don't renew them, as opposed to breaking leases and doing something a bit more aggressive,?? Jim Sullivan, president of the advisory group, said in an interview.Retailers pulled back on stores at U.S. shopping malls last yearSource: Green Street, Advisory & Consulting GroupThe study examines the downsizing trends of the top 25 national retailers lining the hallways of malls across the U.S. These tenants have a bigger impact on landlords' profitability than the large anchors such as Macy's or Bloomingdale's, which typically pay minimal rents or own their stores.??While the department stores take up a lot of space, they don't generate much revenue for the mall owner,?? Sullivan said. ??The mall owner makes most of its money from the in-line tenants.??Even retailers that aren't outwardly struggling are constantly evaluating their options and making strategic decisions about closing stores, according to Green Street. Because in-line tenants have higher rent burdens and shorter lease terms than anchors, they are more likely to leave a center where sales are sagging, and can be better indicators of future problems at a property, the analysts wrote.More than two-thirds of U.S. malls saw a decrease in national retailers, including chains such as Wet Seal, Bebe and Rue 21, which announced a combined 427 store closings last year, Green Street data show. Companies that closed stores without making public statements include Stride Rite, which shuttered 160 locations, and Hallmark, with 101 closures.There are still merchants that are expanding, such as fast-fashion retailer H&M and cosmetics chain Ulta Beauty, according to Green Street. Still, these companies are growing at a slower rate than successful retailers of the past, and are more selective about the malls they enter, the analysts wrote.The best malls are faring relatively well when it comes to national retailers, though they haven't escaped unscathed, while the worst centers have already lost many such tenants, according to Green Street. It's the malls in the middle of the quality spectrum where the departures of in-line tenants could prove most telling, the data show.??Those are the malls that are going to make it or get a lot worse over the next 10 years,?? Sullivan said."

While repurchases could make sense when the company has more financial flexibility, right now it is focused on spending on expanding its businesses and on acquisitions, Sgourdos said.The value gap with Tencent has widened in line with capital outflows from South Africa, where Naspers has its primary listing, Van Dijk said. It will be close to ??impossible?? for Naspers to move its listing from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which has also been protecting the company from hostile takeovers, he said.Van Dijk has resisted pressure to sell Naspers' holding in Tencent, a suggestion that has surfaced over the years.?The Cape Town-based company, which also owns Africa's largest pay-TV business and newspapers, has been focusing on e-commerce and is now among the world's largest investors in the space, backing ventures from Mail.Ru Group Ltd. in Russia to iFood in Brazil.Naspers plans to accelerate the ??path to profitability?? of its e-commerce businesses and sees potential for initial public offerings of companies in its portfolio, Van Dijk said. The company could become purely focused on internet businesses, which now make up about 77 percent of revenues, ??quite quickly,?? he said.???I do not think five years from now people will be picking up newspapers anymore or watching linear TV,?? Van Dijk said.

The deal comes with a business cooperation pact that includes setting aside real estate for Vipshop on JD's site and Tencent's digital wallet, a thriving and integral part of the WeChat messaging service used by close to a billion people.Once known mainly as a video games distributor, Tencent has grown WeChat into China's premier social media platform. Now it plans to use that ubiquity and JD -- in which it holds a significant stake -- to fend off e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Monday's agreement comes days after Tencent unveiled a $635 million deal to buy 5 percent of hypermart chain Yonghui Superstores Co. -- a rare incursion into a physical retail arena that Alibaba covets.??Tencent and JD need this assistance given Alibaba's spectacular execution in 2017,?? said Blue Lotus Capital Advisors Ltd. founder Eric Wen. ??Tencent needs to go from the backstage to the frontstage and that's what they've done. Tencent has acquired a stake in Yonghui and now Vipshop, this is something JD cannot pull off by itself.??Read more: Tencent Doubling Down on Retail Shouldn't Be a Surprise: GadflyTencent's and JD's backing is a boon for Vipshop, which carved out a profitable niche in women's fashion but has now chalked up two successive quarters of net income declines. Despite strong growth across categories like electronics, JD itself is grappling with renewed competition from Alibaba, which last quarter grew revenue 61 percent and is making headway into overseas markets.Tencent and JD are buying Class A Vipshop stock at $65.40 apiece, equivalent to $13.08 per American Depositary Share. Vipshop closed Friday at $8.44 in the U.S. Once completed, Tencent and JD will own about 7 percent and 5.5 percent of Vipshop's issued stock respectively, the two companies said in an emailed statement on Monday.Rather than buy up entire companies, Tencent has traditionally preferred to strike deals with key players in segments it cannot dominate, such as e-commerce and search. Apart from JD, it also owns a substantial stake in Sogou Inc.Its decision to invest jointly with JD may have stemmed in part from Alibaba's growing dominance in online shopping, aided by a massive cloud computing division that's among the world's largest and investments in data capabilities and rural markets. Alibaba's spending billions on physical retailers, which in turn drive online traffic and serves up valuable data for advertising. JD is doing the same but on a much smaller scale, while Tencent's highest-profile effort so far was the Yonghui investment announced Friday.Read more: Tencent to Buy Part of Supermart Chain in Rare Retail ForayJD's investment may herald a bigger acquisition down the road, Wen said.??This is a precursor for JD.com to acquire Vipshop completely because Vipshop doesn't need money and they have plenty of cash,?? he said.As part of the deal, Tencent will give Vipshop a dedicated spot on Weixin Wallet, referring customers to its online shopping platform. JD will also grant Vipshop a potentially lucrative slot on some of its shopping portals and help it achieve sales targets, the companies said.In return, Vipshop offers exposure to apparel and female shoppers -- categories in which it excels. JD Chief Financial Officer Sidney Huang told investors in November that stagnant growth in apparel sales could last several quarters after dozens of merchants left for Alibaba's Tmall.??The strength of Vipshop's flash sale and apparel businesses, as well as its outstanding management team, create clear and strong synergies with us,??

The current software version, iOS 11, added augmented-reality features, a file management app and business-user enhancements for the iPad. For iOS 12, Apple has been working on additions like a redesigned home screen app grid, a multiplayer mode for augmented reality games, and a merger of the third-party applications running on iPhones and Macs, the people said, asking not to be named discussing information that isn't public.?While core features like the combined apps platform are still on schedule to be introduced this year, some flashier changes like the redesigned home screen will likely be held back until the 2019 software update, a person familiar with the matter said. The company will also probably delay a revamped photo management application that used new algorithms to better automatically sort pictures, though some smaller upgrades to the Photos app will still appear this year.The shift in strategy comes following months of criticism due to bugs found in Apple's software. Late last year, researchers discovered a login flaw that allowed intruders to access files without a passcode on Mac computers and vulnerabilities in the company's smart-home platform. Apple has also publicly delayed key new iOS features in recent months, including a feature for synchronizing text messages across Apple devices and its peer to peer payments system, Apple Pay Cash.?New features for parents to better monitor how long apps are being used for by kids and their overall screen time, as well as improvements to Apple's FaceTime video calling service are still on track for this year's update, the people said. A shareholder group recently criticized the parental control on iPhones, pushing Apple to say earlier this month that improvements would be released in a future software update.The company told its software engineering groups about the change this month, one of the people said. The shift will also affect this year's update to Mac computer software, but to a lesser degree, the person said, adding that planned upgrades to Apple Watch and Apple TV software won't be affected.Axios reported earlier on the delay. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The company reports quarterly earnings on Thursday.This isn't the first time Apple has told engineers that focus should be on performance rather than new features.

Dos Santos said her dismissal was ??normal?? in the context of the change in political control.??I think there was a change in vision in terms of where to take the company,?? Dos Santos said in an interview during a conference in the Egyptian resort of?Sharm El-Sheikh. On speculation about the decision, she said: ??I'm not a politician and my focus is on business, on building businesses.??Banco de Fomento Angola, the oil-rich country's second-biggest bank, may sell a stake of as much as 25 percent in an initial public offering in the first quarter of 2019, said Dos Santos, who is vice president of the lender. The bank is controlled by Unitel, Angola's largest telecommunications company, of which Dos Santos owns a 25 percent stake.Lourenco's government is also planning to sell a minority stake in a state-owned telecommunications provider and hold an auction for a fourth industry operator, moves that may threaten Unitel's market share.There are also plans to sell a stake in Luanda-based Banco BIC through a private placement of shares, said Dos Santos. A roadshow to market Angola's fourth-biggest lender to potential investors will take place in the first quarter of 2018, said Dos Santos, who owns a 43 percent stake in Banco BIC and sits on the board.??These banks have gone from strength to strength and I think it's time now to open their capital and receive new shareholders,?? Dos Santos said. Unitel owns 51.9 percent in Banco de Fomento Angola, while Lisbon-based Banco BPI, controlled by Spain's CaixaBank SA, holds the rest.??We're still discussing whether London or Lisbon would be a better place,?? she said. ??But we've already made our intention clear to Angola's central bank and their view was positive.??While the?size of the possible sale of shares in Banco BIC hasn't been decided, it has put together a team to study the share offering and has also picked financial advisers for the sale.Banco BIC, which has operations in Angola, Namibia, Cape Verde and Portugal, would use funds raised from a share sale to fund expansion, and is looking for opportunities in Africa and Asia, said Dos Santos. ??We're looking at mergers, we're looking at acquisitions. We have quite an aggressive acquisition and licensing plan.?? Banco BIC is discussing an opportunity in South Africa, she said, without elaborating.Read more about Dos Santos' departure from Sonangol hereHer dismissal as chair of Sonangol shouldn't affect her investment in Portuguese oil company Galp Energia, where she holds an indirect stake, along with Sonangol and the heirs of Portuguese investor Americo Amorim of 33.4 percent, Dos Santos said.??These are two different things,?? she said. ??The Galp investment is a very old investment, it dates back to 2008. It's a stable investment.??Dos Santos said she remains happy with her investment in Portuguese cable operator NOS, which is controlled by a joint venture Dos Santos owns with Sonaecom SGPS SA.??The position in NOS is one to maintain and to keep,?? said Dos Santos. ??I like to think that our investment in NOS is an investment that will allow it to generate further growth and to look at the possibility of NOS growing in other areas, both inside and outside Portugal.??"
Bitcoin Debit Card May Be Behind 40 Percent Rally in Recent IPO,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/bitcoin-debit-card-may-be-behind-40-percent-rally-in-recent-ipo,"December 12, 2017, 12:24 PM EST",technology,,"While this year's IPOs widely failed to keep pace with the broader market, Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp. has risen nearly 40 percent since last month's listing. The commercial bank's outperformance may be thanks to a bitcoin debit card called Shift Card.Metropolitan is the issuing bank for the Shift Card, which lets users spend bitcoin anywhere that accepts Visa. The card works by exchanging a customer's bitcoin for U.S. dollars at the going rate whenever a sale is processed. This setup lets investors play the growth of bitcoin transactions without forcing the bank to hold the volatile cryptocurrency on its balance sheet.Of the 36 U.S. listings since Nov. 1, only Stitch Fix Inc. has gained more than the New York-based Metropolitan Bank, excluding IPOs below $20 million.

Traders Aren't Falling for Crypto Name Changes But Love Them Anyway,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/a-fool-s-bet-maybe-but-sharks-fuel-crypto-mania-stock-rallies,"January 10, 2018, 5:00 AM EST",markets,"""Professional day traders are jumping into speculative frenzy"", ""HFTs, algos also pour in, trying to profit off of ‘dumb money'""","Who the heck buys into this crypto-mania in the stock market?The answer just might surprise you. Turns out, some experienced day-traders are trying to ride the surge of buying that invariably follows companies that suddenly reinvent themselves as blockchain ventures. That's enough, market watchers say, to bring in high-frequency traders and computer algos.And to these players, what really matters isn't so much that crypto is real, but that the share-price moves -- and the quick profits -- are.??The interest in these stocks is so strong because many traders like me are so hungry for the increased volatility,?? said Jim DePorre, a professional day trader and founder of sharkinvesting.com. ??I know that there are still traders willing to jump in, so who cares if the stock has questionable value???DePorre, who dispenses trading advice and market color using the @RevShark handle?on Twitter, says the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants excitement surrounding anything vaguely tied to cryptocurrencies is just the kind of buzz that attracts short-term traders like him.When buying begets more buying, there's easy money to be made -- as long as you're not the one left holding the bag. The frenzy was on full display Tuesday, when shares of Eastman Kodak Co. more than doubled after the longtime maker of photographic film said it will start issuing its own alt-coin. Kodak's stock kept soaring today, almost doubling again in early trading.DePorre's mum on how much he's made on the trades, but says he's been in-and-out of a number of blockchain names, including the company formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Corp. and Riot Blockchain Inc., often multiple times in a single day.??Everyone is on a crypto-binge right now,?? said Larry Tabb, the founder of research firm Tabb Group. ??Anything associated with it is getting bought up.??The greater fool theory can be a dangerous game. After changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp. in mid-December, the sugary drink seller turned aspiring crypto miner saw its shares surge from roughly $2 to over $9 in a single day. It then quickly fell below $4, and has been wildly fluctuating ever since. The stock closed at $5.80 on Tuesday, which is still good for a 138 percent gain from its pre-blockchain days.??It's a technology with great potential, but investors need to be extremely skeptical,?? said Steve Sosnick, chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers, ??because these companies are flashing a big, red caveat emptor.??Read all about bitcoin, blockchain and the world of cryptos.DePorre, who does his day trading the old-fashioned way, says his wits and experience have kept him from sustaining painful missteps vis-a-vis other traders. But the popularity and durability of the crypto craze has almost certainly lured ultrafast computer trading firms as well, according to Jim Kyung-Soo Liew, an assistant finance professor at Johns Hopkins University and founder of machine-learning consultancy SoKat Consulting.??High frequency traders know certain words can make stocks move,?? he said. ??They can definitely key in on that and try to get in front.??The spikes in volume have probably also attracted various algorithmic buyers that weren't necessarily looking for the next crypto-related trade, according to Tucker Balch, co-founder of Lucena Research.??My hypothesis is that momentum is initiated by retail traders or pump and dump and then algos are hopping on the bandwagon.??That may leave investors vulnerable to bad actors trying to game the system and the market feeling a little like the Wild West, according to Michael Covel, author of ??Trend Following?? and ??The Complete Turtle Trader.?? But it's a small price to pay if cryptos ultimately prove to be legit.??Con artists will always try to ride the new new thing,?? he said. ??But if cryptos are for real, and keep growing into dynamic liquid markets, honest players, including momentum, will jump in to ride trends up and down.??In the mean time, traders like DePorre couldn't care less what kind of money is in on the blockchain name-change game -- dumb money, fast money or otherwise -- as long as there's enough money willing to bet on it.??As long as there is confidence that other traders are still willing to trade them,?? he said, ??there is no reason to stay away.??For more on cryptocurrencies, check out the Decrypted podcast:"

Bitcoin Takes Bigger Wall Street Stage With Smooth CME Debut,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-17/bitcoin-heads-to-bigger-wall-street-stage-as-cme-debuts-futures,"December 17, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",markets,"""Trading follows similar offering by Cboe exchange a week ago"", ""CME futures off to faster start as underlying bitcoin climbs""","The world's biggest exchange just joined the bitcoin revolution.Bitcoin futures started trading Sunday night at CME Group Inc.'s venue, a week after Chicago rival Cboe Global Markets Inc. introduced similar derivatives on the volatile cryptocurrency. CME is a much bigger player in futures, so many traders expected it to make a bigger splash in the nascent space.CME got off to a faster start with more efficient pricing. Its most-active contract changed hands 221 times in the first hour versus 570 during Cboe's debut. But that's a win because CME's contracts are five times more valuable -- they're tied to five bitcoins compared with only one with Cboe's futures.??People were better prepared?? for the start of trading at CME, said Bobby Cho, head of trading at Cumberland, the cryptocurrency trading unit of DRW Holdings LLC. ??They knew how they were going to hedge their positions.??CME's futures traded at about 2 percent above bitcoin itself as of 11:56 a.m. in London; in the first day, Cboe's got as much as 13 percent above, a sign trading was relatively inefficient. Bitcoin today climbed 9 percent from its Friday New York close to $19,190, approaching the record $19,511 reached hours earlier.The CME and Cboe bitcoin futures have some distinct features. The price of Cboe's product is derived from the cryptocurrency's price at a single exchange; CME's is based off four.??We were waiting for the launch of the CME futures because the price is more robust and the exchange trades much larger volumes,?? Jose Miguel Nascimento, head trader at cryptocurrency fund Solidus Capital, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. ??Futures are a very positive development for the bitcoin market, as it will help everyone from miners to traders hedge risk, and having a price curve will help limit price swings.??The CME futures are another step into the mainstream financial world for an asset created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative?to banks and government-issued currencies.?The contracts, which settle in dollars and trade on regulated exchanges, can be bought by institutional investors that are prohibited from buying bitcoin directly on largely unregulated exchanges.??One of the biggest issues when it comes to investing institutionally in digital assets is banks and larger institutions can't hold an unregulated instrument in their balance sheet, and a futures contract is something they can hold,?? said Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital-asset strategy at VanEck Associates Corp. With futures, ??you don't hold the physical bitcoin, which solves custody issues and counterparty risks with these less-regulated exchanges.??To protect against wild, mistaken price swings, CME will briefly pause trading if the contracts rise or fall 7 percent or 13 percent, and prices won't be allowed to move more than 20 percent. That wasn't necessary in its debut. Cboe also has volatility halts, which were triggered in the initial hours of trading a week ago, and its January contract rose as much as 26 percent on the first day.Cboe's website stalled during its launch. CME's seemed to weather the traffic.??It's only one-lots,???said?Garrett See, chief executive officer of crypto trading firm DV Chain of the initial CME trades. ??The prices are moving around pretty fast.?? The order book was pretty thin and ??the orders that are there are very small.??Read more: A QuickTake on bitcoin futuresFutures open up arbitrage opportunities -- the chance to bet prices of the derivatives and the underlying cryptocurrency will converge. Last week, Cboe's product was priced as much as 13 percent higher than bitcoin, but that quickly narrowed. By Sunday night, it was similar to CME's.Some brokerages didn't immediately give customers access to bitcoin futures. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. said late Friday that it will offer Cboe's starting on Monday, though it'll wait to offer the CME contracts until they demonstrate sufficient liquidity. E*Trade Financial Corp. is considering offering bitcoin futures, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.??We look at the volume, the open interest and the spreads, and we want to make sure that all those conditions are maturing properly,?? said JB Mackenzie, managing director for futures trading at TD Ameritrade. ??We have had a lot of customer interest, and we have spent a lot of time educating them as to the differences between the two products.??QuickTake: All About Bitcoin, Blockchain and Their Crypto WorldBanks and brokers who are offering access are being cautious. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. demanded some clients set aside collateral equal to 100 percent of the value of their trades, people familiar with the investments said last week. The guidelines are inclusive of other margin requirements such as Options Clearing Corp.'s 44 percent, required to clear contracts traded at Cboe, and the 47 percent CME is demanding.It's not uncommon for a brokerage to impose steeper requirements than the exchange. Interactive Brokers Group Inc., which has said it handled 53 percent of the first day's trading in Cboe's bitcoin futures, will require a margin of 50 percent for long investments, and about 240 percent for short selling, based on current rates, according to Interactive Brokers spokeswoman Kalen Holliday.??

Instead, its shares have tumbled to a five-year low amid a focus on opening new brick-and-mortar stores at a record pace.?Liverpool, which traces its roots to a Mexico City clothing store set up in 1847, offers fewer products online than its peers do and many of its items can only be?purchased in stores. Shipping is free but can take longer than five days when?there's high demand, compared with as little as one day for some Amazon orders. Perhaps most importantly, it doesn't accept cash payments for online?purchases, which cuts off a big chunk of the population in Mexico, where fewer than half of adults?have credit cards.???Liverpool's business model is largely threatened,?? Credit Suisse analysts led by Antonio Gonzalez wrote in a note this week. ??Investors should no longer think about e-commerce in Mexico as a phenomenon that will impact stock prices in the distant future. The future for e-commerce is now.??While online shopping only represents about 3 percent of retail sales in Mexico, analysts at HSBC predict it's set to grow substantially after Amazon introduced its Prime membership club to Mexico earlier this year. A potential change to the North American Free Trade Agreement that would let Mexican consumers buy more online from the U.S. and Canada without having to pay tariffs could also lead to more cross-border e-commerce.Liverpool shares have tumbled 17 percent this year. Walmex has gained 18 percent and Mexico's benchmark stock gauge is up 3.7 percent.Alejandra Tovar, a spokeswoman for Liverpool, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.El Puerto de Liverpool is planning to open 11 stores this year, expanding floor space by 6 percent, according to its latest earnings report.But it's only invested about $30 million on e-commerce in Mexico during the past few years -- the same amount that MercadoLibre has invested on free shipping in Mexico this year alone, according to Credit Suisse. Wal-Mart de Mexico has spent about $190 million on online efforts during the past two years, Credit Suisse says. Amazon, which entered Mexico in 2015, is planning to open a warehouse near Mexico City that would triple its distribution space, Reuters reported in September.Market share for online salesThese efforts already appear to be paying off: Mercado Libre captured 9.5 percent of online sales last year while e-commerce platform Linio, Amazon and Wal-Mart de Mexico each controlled just under 6 percent of the market, according to data from Euromonitor International Ltd. El Puerto de Liverpool's online sales were 1.7 percent of the market.??Mercado Libre is investing at a pace that is simply not being followed by bricks-and-mortar players, which will create a permanent dislocation in market share,??

Undercover agents impersonated taxi drivers to subvert opposition to the ride-hailing app. Uber also had a team devoted to the automated collection of information, or scraping, of competitor information from the internet. The practice, also referred to as ??fusking,?? relies on finding source code inadvertently left unprotected.While the legality of the practices detailed in the letter may vary among countries, the allegation that Uber was using them widely won't help its expansion into international markets. The company is already paying a price for its practices in London, where the company was banned from operating due to safety and regulatory concerns. It's still operating in the city until an appeal of the decision is heard next year.The ex-manager behind the letter, Richard Jacobs, was either a disgruntled employee or a whistle blower who quit because he found Uber's practices objectionable -- or something in between. Uber paid him $4.5 million to settle his claims, get his cooperation investigating them, and to prevent him from publicly disparaging the company. Jacobs recanted some of his assertions as a witness in a November court hearing, leading a top Uber lawyer to describe the letter as an effort at ??extortion.??Prosecutors turned the letter over last month to U.S. District Judge William Alsup because they were concerned it might be important to the civil trade-secrets case Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo unit brought against Uber for self-driving technology. Alsup, who is handling the Waymo suit, unsealed the letter Friday.??While we haven't substantiated all the claims in this letter -- and, importantly, any related to Waymo -- our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology,?? Uber spokesman Matt Kallman said in an email.Fusking can be illegal under U.S. laws designed to protect access to information on networks, said Michael Risch, a professor at Villanova University School of Law in Pennsylvania.??This is another mess for Uber's new team to be cleaning up,?? Risch said in an email. ??It is hard to take them seriously when they apparently paid someone they called an extortionist $4.5 million to ??assist' with an internal investigation, especially when Uber claims that these things are not happening.??The letter, written on Jacobs's behalf by his own lawyer, Clayton D. Halunen, describes how Uber's web scraping was used to lift competitor ride sharing companies' driver information, pricing structures and incentives. Uber impersonated drivers on competitor platforms to understand their apps, with the aim of siphoning drivers away, according to the letter.Uber relied on undercover agents to undermine taxi drivers and their companies, Halunen wrote. The letter blacks out what country the agents operated in but one goal was to identify local politicians and groups opposing Uber. In one instance, an agent impersonated a taxi driver to learn about resistance to Uber and anticipate their plans, Halunen wrote.""The agents took rides in local taxis, loitered around locations where taxi drivers congregated, and leveraged a local network of contacts with connections to police and regulatory authorities,"" according to the letter.Halunun received $3.5 million from Uber as part of his client's settlement with the company.?He didn't return a call and email after regular business hours seeking comment about the letter.

Chances are, the new year will muddle the debate further.With a flurry of policy announcements expected out of Washington in 2018 -- and their potentially conflicting effects on the auto industry -- overall industry sales are expected to remain flat.Technology for self-driven cars and electric vehicles will continue to dominate the headlines for automakers and suppliers, as industry players strive to stake their claims on the fast-changing landscape. Meanwhile, car sales will remain on the ""eroding plateau"" trajectory for the year, with the final numbers fairly close to 2017's expected annual sales of 17.1 million units. Which is not to say that there are no bright spots.Auto-parts retailers are expected to have a good run in 2018 as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the corporate tax overhaul, and as more vehicles age into the ""sweet spot"" that triggers demand for repair parts. Auto dealers, on the other hand, may see some weakness after a few months of storm-fueled surge in demand.Analysts are looking to a 2018 of lower sales, a cooling China market, and a ""narrative shift"" in the industry to ""technology enablers versus traditional industrials."""

It traded higher by 45 percent to $3,435.36 as of 9 a.m., according to data compiled from coinmarketcap.com.

There's an $814 Million Mystery Near the Heart of the Biggest Bitcoin Exchange,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/mystery-shrouds-tether-and-its-links-to-biggest-bitcoin-exchange,"December 5, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",technology,"""After Wells Fargo severed ties, Tether won't name its banks"", ""Bitfinex says it's hired a law firm to contest false claims""","Among the many mysteries at the heart of the cryptocurrency market are these: Does $814 million of a digital token known as tether really exist? And what is tether's connection to Bitfinex, the world's biggest bitcoin exchange?This is the state of crypto in late 2017, where questions about the companies behind the currencies are multiplying with the profits. While cryptocurrencies appeal to people who lack faith in governments and banks, the digital assets often require a blind trust in companies about which few facts are available.Tether Read More: Bitcoin Heads to Wall Street Whether Regulators Are Ready or NotTake tether. The currency, which started trading in 2015, is described as a stable alternative to bitcoin's wild price swings. A restaurant owner who accepts bitcoin but fears its volatility could shift bitcoin into tether, which can be easier to do than exchanging bitcoin for dollars. Its price has stayed near $1 for most of its life because Tether, the company behind the digital token, says that every tether is backed by one U.S. dollar held in reserve. Since there's $814 million of tether circulating, there should be $814 million parked in bank accounts somewhere.Not everyone believes there is.??Is there anything backing this??? said Tim Swanson, who does risk analysis for blockchain and cryptocurrency startups. Swanson, also director of research at Post Oaks Labs, said he fears problems with tether could hobble exchanges that trade it. ??If these aren't backed 1-to-1, then what is the contagion risk if one of these exchanges goes down???Some wonder whether tether has helped pump up the price of bitcoin, which recently surpassed $11,000 after beginning the year below $1,000. Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin, the world's seventh-largest cryptocurrency, wrote in a Nov. 30 Twitter post, ??There's a fear going on that the recent price rise was helped by printing of USDT (Tether) that is not backed by USD in a bank account.??Little public information exists about how tether is created, fueling questions, said Barry Leybovich, a product manager at IPC System who creates risk and compliance products for financial institutions interested in blockchain applications. The market believes that each tether is worth $1, even if they're not actually backed by that money, and trades of tether for bitcoin at Bitfinex are helping drive up the price of bitcoin, he said.Tether's website makes a claim that's unusual among cryptocurrencies: ??every tether is always backed 1-to-1 by traditional currency held in our reserves.?? The site also says each tether can be redeemed for $1. But its terms of service say: ??There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of tethers by us for money.??On Dec. 2, Bitfinex released a quarterly report announcing it would no longer serve U.S. customers because it's too expensive to do business with them. This followed Wells Fargo & Co.'s decision earlier in the year to end its role as a correspondent bank through which customers in the U.S. could send money to Bitfinex and Tether's banks in Taiwan. Bitfinex and Tether filed suit against Wells Fargo, but later withdrew the case.??We continue to experience banking bottlenecks for some customers, but are proceeding to open accounts around the world,?? according to the quarterly report. ??While we have some clear challenges, please note that tens of millions of dollars continue to flow in and out of Bitfinex daily. Although not available to everyone, these fiat flows have been sufficient to keep our market in alignment with other exchanges as we continue to gain market share.??Bitfinex and Tether identified four Taiwanese banks in the Wells Fargo lawsuit. However, Ronn Torossian, a spokesman for Bitfinex and Tether, refused to identify their current banks unless a reporter signed a non-disclosure agreement, an offer that wasn't accepted.Documents posted online show Bitfinex directing prospective customers to Poland's Bank Spoldzielczy in Skierniewice. Torossian wouldn't comment on whether the documents are authentic.Wladyslaw Klazynski, the bank's chief executive officer, wouldn't confirm if any accounts have been opened by Bitfinex clients, citing Polish financial law that forbids revealing client data. ??We are in touch with the Polish financial market watchdog in order to explain media information?? about the situation, he said in a phone interview, adding that his firm isn't ??financially engaged?? with any company trading bitcoin.Neither Tether nor Bitfinex disclose?on their websites or in any public documents where they're located or who's in charge, but information is available elsewhere.Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is CEO of both Bitfinex and Tether, Torossian said by email on Dec. 3. A LinkedIn page for someone named J. L. van der Velde, who identifies himself as Bitfinex's CEO, says he speaks Dutch, English, German, Italian and Chinese, attended National Taiwan Normal University from 1985 to 1988 and was previously CEO of PAG Asia Inc.Phil Potter is a Tether director, according to documents -- dubbed the Paradise Papers -- recently leaked by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. He's also the chief strategy officer at Bitfinex. A graduate of Yale University, Potter?worked as a derivatives analyst for Morgan Stanley and then moved to the private client services unit at Bear Stearns Cos., where he worked on technology infrastructure and software design. He's given many interviews that can be found on YouTube, including Q&As after Bitfinex was hacked last year.Bitfinex incorporated in Hong Kong in 2013, but then changed its name to Renrenbee Ltd. a year later, according to Companies Registry in Hong Kong. Giancarlo Devasini is listed as a director at Renrenbee by Companies Registry. He's identified as a Tether director in the Paradise Papers.Torossian said van der Velde, Potter and Devasini weren't available for interviews.Oguz Serdar said he tried tether, but came away disappointed. When Turkey banned PayPal last year, he began using bitcoin to pay contractors working with his advertising technology company, then started investing in it on his own. When he feared bitcoin was poised to drop, he said he shifted funds into tether. ??It's a way to park your gains,?? he explained in a telephone interview. ??It's what you do temporarily.??He said that in early November he tried to cash out $1 million of tether, a request Tether refused.??Due to ongoing banking difficulties we are only able to process requests for verified corporate customers,?? Serdar was told by Tether, according to emails he shared with Bloomberg News. Serdar said the company stated that its currency was backed by reserves, meaning it was one of few places to exchange tethers for dollars, and while he didn't have an account he approached them to find out who they banked with.Tether, Serdar says, declined to disclose its banks and instead recommended in an email that he try to sell on one of the exchange partners it lists on its website. More than a dozen names appear there, but many don't offer investors a way to exchange tether for dollars. One that does is Kraken, but Serdar didn't think that market could handle his trade.???The demand side is entirely empty there,?? he said. ??You try to sell $1 million of U.S. dollar tether, the price crashes to zero, so you don't do that.??Serdar ??doesn't have any money with us and he never did,?? Torossian said. ??The customer in question was flagged as suspicious because of numerous irregularities,?? he added. ??If this customer wishes to complete our KYC process properly, we may review this matter further. Until that time, this individual will not be permitted to do business with us,?? he said, referring to know-your-customer regulations that require financial firms to vet their clients.Serdar said he alerted the U.S. Treasury Department and the Justice Department about his concerns regarding Tether through an online tip website, but hasn't heard back. As for how the company characterizes him now, he said, ??they're speculating on me being some type of enemy.??On Dec. 3, Bitfinex said it had hired law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP because of ??false claims and related activity by various parties,?? according to an emailed press release. ??To date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem,?? Stuart Hoegner, counsel for Bitfinex, said in the statement.Serdar says he eventually traded his $1 million tether stake for bitcoin. ??I don't think they have even $100 million or $200 million in a legitimate country,?? he said. ??It's the elephant in the room, but a lot of people don't want to talk about it because they're invested in it.????

The same day, one of China's most-senior officials called for more aggressive government involvement online to combat terrorism and criminals. Wang Huning, one of seven men on China's top decision-making body, even called for a global response team to go well beyond its borders.Wang HuningIt was Cook's second appearance in China in two months, following a meeting with President Xi Jinping in October. The iPhone maker has most of its products manufactured in the country and is trying to regain market share in smartphones against local competitors such as Huawei Technologies Co.??The theme of this conference -- developing a digital economy for openness and shared benefits -- is a vision we at Apple share,?? Cook said. ??We are proud to have worked alongside many of our partners in China to help build a community that will join a common future in cyberspace.""Cook Kissed the Ring in China Because He Had No Choice: GadflyThe Wuzhen conference, which until this year has had a primarily local presence, is designed to globally promote the country's vision of a more censored and controlled internet. The attendance of leaders from two of the world's most valuable tech giants lends credibility to China's efforts to influence the global internet so it better resembles its own.??It is interesting to see Apple and Google at the WIC, but we doubt there will be any meaningful changes in China government policy,?? said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research. ??Current policies have worked very well so far: two of the top five internet companies in terms of market cap are Chinese -- supported by growth in consumer spending which is a key government priority.??The two companies Boodry referred to participated in the conference, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma and Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s Pony Ma taking part. The other technology executives in attendance included Cisco Systems Inc.'s Chuck Robbins and Baidu Inc. co-founder Robin Li.Cook's comments come at a pivotal point for the company's future in China, which is now its biggest market outside of North America. It relies on the sale of hardware and services in the world's most populous country to propel revenue and profit growth. But the efforts required to stay in China's good graces are causing tensions with civil libertarians and politicians at home.Tim Cook at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen on Dec. 3.He said Apple's operations in the country began three decades ago with a handful of employees. Today, it helps support more than 5 million jobs in China, including 1.8 million local mobile app developers, he added.Apple has come under fire for cooperating with Chinese authorities in removing apps that give users there uncensored communications. In November, Apple complied with government orders to pull Microsoft Corp.'s Skype phone and video service from the Chinese version of its popular app store. Cook used an earnings call with investors to justify such moves, saying it obeyed the laws of the markets where it operates.??Much has been said of the potential downsides of AI, but I don't worry about machines thinking like humans. I worry about people thinking like machines,?? he said. ??We all have to work to infuse technology with humanity, with our values.??Technology of the future should have openness, creativity and safeguards to protect users while providing privacy and decency, he added.It's a goal that, according to Cook's Chinese hosts, can only be accomplished through more laws and regulations that control what can be shared online. Wang, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, called for a global emergency response team that would respond in times of crisis using new and undetermined measures. China goes far beyond censoring content that could support terrorists and criminals. It also blocks Facebook, Twitter and many Western commercial and educational web sites.??What we propose is we should promote a controllable security and build a new order,?? Wang said through a translator. ??Cybersecurity is a serious challenge. Cyber crimes and cyber terrorism have grown more rampant.

The majority stakeholder in Egypt's Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE was among those who initially voiced a willingness to invest, before getting spooked by investor infighting.

Christmas Becomes Inventory War Game for U.S. Fashion Brands,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-08/christmas-becomes-inventory-war-game-for-u-s-fashion-brands,"December 8, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",business,"""Companies relying on radio-frequency tags, machine learning"", ""Idea is to end season without need for another big fire sale""","Michael Kors Holdings Ltd., Ralph Lauren Corp. and other fashion brands are locked in a high-stakes contest this Christmas.But the winner won't be the company that sells the most -- it'll be the one that winds up with the least amount of unwanted merchandise.After years of struggling to manage their inventory, brands are using increasingly sophisticated tools to track apparel and accessories through the supply chain, aiming to avoid the typical post-Christmas fire sales. The idea is to improve profit margins, even if it means ceding some revenue.Despite the technological advancements, it's still no easy task. The decline of department stores has exacerbated the problem in recent years, with their nonstop discounting hurting the prestige of brands like Polo and Kate Spade. That's increased pressure on brands to show they can get the balancing act right this holiday season.??There's a dashboard that they are watching,???said David Bassuk, co-head of the retail practice at AlixPartners LLP. ??It's literally managing a war.??This year's Black Friday early results suggested customers are willing to spend more again -- but the benefits aren't being spread equally across the industry. Even with discounts, brick-and-mortar stores failed to boost customer traffic. Shopping is increasingly flowing online, with mobile devices becoming the preferred means of commerce.Every Monday morning, retailers typically hold a manager meeting to look at the sell-through rates, or the percentage of the total inventory sold, for the past week. During the holiday period, they meet daily -- and decide if they should use promotions or increase their markdowns to stay on track with their inventory, Bassuk said.The rise of omnichannel marketing -- the notion of having brick-and-mortar stores work seamlessly with e-commerce operations -- has made matters more complicated. Customers, for instance, may buy an item online and then return it to a store.??This holiday season is more critical than the recent past to get this right,?? Bassuk said. ??There's a lot of speculation about whether retailers are really able to manage inventory properly in the world of omnichannel.??Michael Kors and other upscale brands are still using discounts to drive sales. But they're aiming to be more targeted with their promotions.Michael Kors Chief Executive Officer John Idol has pledged to cut the number of days with big promotions by as much as 65 percent this quarter. The company is currently offering 25 percent off purchases, but that deal ends on Dec. 12.Building an impression of scarcity is key for high-end brands. Toward the end, Michael Kors lowered its number of stock-keeping units by 12 percent this month, according to retail data tracker Edited.Overall, there's little sense that promotions have abated this holiday season. In the week leading up to Black Friday, the number of marked-down apparel and accessories was up threefold from the same period of 2014, according to Edited, which used data from the websites of America's 19 largest retailers.But there's hope that smarter promotions will set up retailers and fashion brands for a better 2018. The industry also has closed thousands of stores this year, helping supply better match demand.Tapestry Inc., the owner of the Coach and Kate Spade brands, uses historical seasonal sales data to build its stock allocation plan for each store. And it has the capability to restock its retail stores as many as three times a week during the holiday season,?said?spokeswoman Andrea Resnick.Investors appear optimistic about fashion brands' prospects: Tapestry shares climbed 20 percent this year through Thursday's close, while Michael Kors gained 39 percent and Ralph Lauren increased 11 percent. All three companies advanced in Friday trading as U.S. stocks rose.Retailers have traditionally been dependent on historical sales and loyalty data to predict trends. In an era of big data, they're relying more on analytics and machine learning -- a form of artificial intelligence -- to better maintain inventory.They build out customer profiles based on shopping patterns, helping companies predict the kind of assortments and quantity needed for their websites and stores,?said JoAnn Martin, vice president of retail industry strategy at supply-chain management company JDA Software Group Inc.But the rise of e-commerce and increasing demand for fast delivery have made the process more complicated, she said. That's what led to especially bad inventory problems in recent years.??With a lack of understanding of where to put that product, they bought more than they needed,?? Martin said.High-end department stores and specialty retailers have started tagging their products with radio-frequency identification sensors, which casinos have been using for their gambling chips, to track inventory in real time.Managers still sometimes make gut decisions, but it's a gamble, said JDA's Martin. Coach didn't anticipate that products with prominent logos had come back in fashion, and its outlets failed to stock enough of the merchandise last quarter.In a skittish retail industry, it's probably safer to stock too little than too much. But that means companies will have lower sales growth when they begin to rebound, said?Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Instinet LLC.He likens lean inventories to being on antibiotics, a painful but necessary part of getting healthy again.??Companies who have been sick -- and have already been on a year of antibiotics -- need to take another round,???he said.??

The agreement builds on a joint venture Toyota and Panasonic have had for over two decades.As global rivals from Volkswagen AG to General Motors Co. spend billions of dollars to shape the future of electric cars, Toyota is on a mission to catch up. President?Akio Toyoda, the 61-year-old grandson of founder Kiichiro Toyoda, has acknowledged that Toyota has been a???a little bit late?? on EVs, with governments around the world cracking down on pollution caused by fossil fuels.??Electrification is a major part of the once-a-century transformation taking place in the auto industry now,?? Toyoda told reporters in Tokyo Wednesday. ??In order to make ever-better cars, we need to collaborate with a specialized battery manufacturer.?? The safety of EV batteries is a ??pressing issue,?? he added.The carmaker is open to other companies joining the partnership to speed the pace of development, Toyoda said.Read more on Toyota's hydrogen car betToyota has picked up the pace with development of electric cars amid a boom this year, after initially betting on hydrogen to power its zero-emission vehicles. The company launched a venture with Mazda Motor Corp. and affiliate-supplier Denso Corp. in September for EV parts across a spectrum of models. Toyota plans to introduce electric models by 2020 in China and India, where it's partnering with Suzuki Motor Corp.While Nissan Motor Co. has sold some 300,000 of the all-electric Leaf since 2010 and Tesla Inc. has delivered more than 250,000 EVs since the first Roadster rolled out in 2008, neither Toyota, Mazda nor Suzuki offer battery-powered passenger cars.Toyota aims to have an electric component in 50 percent of all its vehicle sales by 2030, including hybrid cars, Toyoda said. The company wants to increase hybrid sales to 4.5 million by 2030.It has also been pouring resources into the development of a solid-state battery that it aims to have in electric vehicles by the early 2020s. Solid-state batteries promise to offer shorter charging times, longer driving ranges and improved safety from current-generation lithium-ion cells.Panasonic provides lithium-ion cells for Toyota models including the plug-in Prius. Panasonic and Toyota have had a joint venture since 1996?called Primearth EV Energy Co., which makes lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries for other Toyota cars. Toyota controls 80.5 percent of the entity, with Panasonic owning the remainder.The Osaka-based electronics maker is also the exclusive battery supplier for Tesla's current production models, and partnered with the company on its $5 billion gigafactory in Nevada.Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects that electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales will surpass 1 million units this year for the first time, as charging infrastructure becomes more accessible and manufacturers produce models with longer driving ranges.

He is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Sean Cox in Detroit federal court on Dec. 6. He faces up to seven years in prison.In a letter to the judge last week, Schmidt,?former general manager of Volkswagen's U.S. Environment and Engineering Office, said he first learned about the company's emissions-testing evasion scheme in the summer of 2015. Schmidt said he was given ""a script, or talking points"" approved by VW management and ""high-ranking lawyers"" to follow when he met with a California environmental official, Alberto Ayala, on Aug. 5, 2015.""Regrettably, I agreed to follow it,"" Schmidt said. ""In hindsight, I should have never agreed to meet with Dr. Ayala on that day. Or, better yet, I should have gone to that meeting, ignored the instructions given to me"" and admitted ""there was a defeat device in VW diesel engine vehicles and that VW had been cheating for almost a decade.""VW spokesman Nicolai Laude declined to comment. Bild-Zeitung in Germany earlier reported on the letter.Schmidt, a 48-year-old German national, described himself as a small player in the automaker's emission's cheating scandal in February, when he asked a judge to release him from a maximum-security prison. His request was denied.In August, veteran VW engineer?James Liang was sentenced to 40 months in prison for his role in helping the German carmaker cheat U.S. emissions tests. Liang was the first person prosecuted in the scandal.Liang and Schmidt are among eight VW executives criminally charged for their alleged roles in the scheme. The charges followed VW's admission in September 2015 that about 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide were outfitted with so-called defeat devices that helped them pass emissions testing. An investigation is ongoing in Germany and against individuals in the U.S.The case is U.S. v. Schmidt, 16-cr-20394, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).??

There are no current plans, and details such as the timing and scale of the offering have yet to be worked out, he said.??We'd like to do a meaningful public offering,"" Bang, 45, said in his first public acknowledgment about a potential sale. Still, the company needs to become bigger and establish a sustainable production system before proceeding with an IPO, he said.Such an offering would be the biggest in the blooming K-pop industry in two decades and help Big Hit further capitalize on the success of the seven-member boy band after performances at last month's American Music Awards and on Ellen DeGeneres's talk show. BTS is so popular that people have retweeted about or liked them on Twitter an estimated half-a-billion times this year -- more than U.S. President Donald Trump and Justin Bieber combined.Revenue at Big Hit, which only manages a handful of lesser-known clients besides BTS, will probably double this year after doubling annually since BTS debuted in 2013, according to the company.?Maeil Business Newspaper reported last month, citing one of Big Hit's shareholders, that the company generated about $30 million in revenue last year. By comparison, analysts estimate about $300 million in revenue for market leader SM Entertainment Co., home to boy band EXO, and $90 million for JYP Entertainment Corp., with girl group Twice, this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Read more: K-pop chasing a ??Michael Jackson Moment' for $4.7 billion playlistBang,?whose cousin is the billionaire founder of Netmarble Games Corp., had refrained from talking about going public, but that hasn't stopped local media and analysts from speculating on the likelihood of an IPO.??Big Hit Entertainment's market cap may exceed its peers' value,?? said Yang Seungwoo at Samsung Securities Co., who covers entertainment companies in Korea. ??They could get a high valuation amid a boom in the Kosdaq and if they can diversify their revenue sources with various artists, digital streaming profits and concert tours overseas.??Bang Si HyukThough he's currently focused on BTS, Bang said he's preparing to introduce a new boy band using a ??success formula?? that could be replicated with other K-pop bands seeking to break into the U.S. charts. He's weighing whether to team up with a music giant or go it alone and directly strike deals with U.S. music labels, radio promoters and public-relations firms, Bang said.Bang, known in the industry as ??Hitman,?? wouldn't specify his strategy, but social media likely has something to do with it. BTS's ??MIC Drop?? music video has garnered more than 68 million views on YouTube since its release in November -- more than for Selena Gomez's ??Wolves.??Though BTS is dwarfed by artists such as?Bieber in terms of Twitter followers, the Korean band has been liked or retweeted 502 million times this year, ranking it first worldwide, according to New York-based researcher Shareablee Inc. Bieber has been liked or retweeted 22 million times, and Trump 213 million times, according to Shareablee. Twitter Inc. this month crowned BTS as the world's most tweeted-about celebrity in 2017.Yet it's not just Twitter. BTS is ubiquitous on social media in its home market of Korea, where it has the highest following on Naver Corp.'s live broadcasting app V LIVE and has a messaging-sticker business with Line Corp. The band has about 1.4 million followers on Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s QQ Music service.??Social media was a big part of why BTS managed to break into the mainstream U.S. market,?? said Anna-Michelle Lavandier, an analyst at Shareablee. Getting a high number of likes and retweets -- also known as ??actions?? -- is a key measure of how fast one's influence is spreading, she said.Streaming services Spotify, Apple Music and AccuRadio have dedicated K-pop channels, as does the biggest service in China -- QQ Music, which has 100 million daily active users.For Bang, who spoke earlier this month, BTS is the latest trophy of his long career in Korea's music scene. In the 1990s, he helped found JYP Entertainment with K-pop giant Park Jin Young, where he composed songs for more than a dozen artists such as Rain but never called the shots. Because of a self-professed distaste for being bossed around, Bang branched out on his own to set up Big Hit in 2005.Big Hit's early days were tough, and it almost went bankrupt in 2007 after the company, which only had four employees, signed up just a handful of artists, Bang said. Business was so slow that the company's artists only came by to play daily tennis matches on the office's Nintendo Wii, he said. The company's first breakthrough came in 2009, when its 8Eight's ??Without a Heart?? became a local hit. Then Bang created BTS and produced some of their songs.K-pop has exploded in popularity around the world thanks to YouTube.Today, BTS is Korea's ??it?? band. The group was No. 10 for the year on the Billboard U.S. charts, and it's planning major overseas concert tours next year. Bang's plans for BTS include generating as much revenue as top American stars now.While such goals may not be realistic in the near future, what's clear is that the band is winning over non-Korean fans.??I wasn't a K-pop fan, but then I saw how passionate BTS was about their music and their fans and everything they do,?? said?Josie Gates,?a 19-year-old from Pennsylvania now studying in Seoul who went to a BTS concert this month. ??I became a really die-hard fan.????

Microsoft Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said Tuesday in a blog post announcing the actions.The harassment allegations brought new scrutiny to the practice of private arbitration, which in many cases has helped keep these cases out of the public eye, and potentially kept the accused from facing more serious consequences. Companies have increasingly included non-disparagement and non-disclosure clauses in employee contracts, as well as ones that prevent workers from suing in court. While arbitration clauses are not standard at Microsoft, the company's move makes it a prominent early adopter of policies that could combat inappropriate behavior in the workplace by making such misconduct public.In 2015, three female employees brought a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination against Microsoft, seeking class-action status. Recently unsealed documents from the case detailed harassment complaints and settlements, internal skepticism around gender pay equality and incidents investigated by human resources.?The stories from the files shed light on how the company struggled to handle sexual harassment and gender bias complaints."
Broadcom Projects Robust Sales on Strong Smartphone Demand,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/broadcom-projects-upbeat-sales-on-strong-smartphone-demand,"December 6, 2017, 4:21 PM EST",technology,"""Apple supplier posts jump in wireless chip unit revenue"", ""Chipmaker sticking to long-term target of 5% annual growth""","Broadcom Ltd., the chipmaker that is trying to pull off the biggest takeover in the history of technology, gave an upbeat sales forecast, indicating that its smartphone customers are optimistic about demand.Revenue in the period that ends Feb. 4 will be about $5.3 billion, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with analysts' average estimate of $4.83 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The forecast includes a partial contribution from the recently acquired networking business of Brocade Communications Systems Inc.Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan has led his company's climb up the ranks of chipmakers in the past three years through a series of acquisitions. That scale now makes its earnings an indicator of demand across the communications industry, in particular because Broadcom is a major supplier of components to Apple Inc. for the iPhone. It's trying to extend that reach even further through a $105 billion offer made in early November for Qualcomm Inc., the biggest maker of chips that power smartphones.Qualcomm's board and management rejected the $70-a-share bid as too low and said the transaction would face regulatory challenges. Broadcom responded by reiterating that it will continue its approach, and earlier this week nominated a replacement group of directors to Qualcomm's board.Broadcom has had preliminary discussions with regulators and expects to be able to get a deal for Qualcomm closed within about a year of signing of an agreement, Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause said on a conference call about the earnings. The company refused to take any questions on the topic.Broadcom shares gained about 4 percent in extended trading following release of the quarterly results. They had earlier closed at $263.89, leaving them up 49 percent this year. That compares with a 36 percent gain by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.The company's wireless communications business, which supplies components such as Wi-Fi chips, chalked up revenue growth of 33 percent to $1.8 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. Sales in its biggest division, wired infrastructure, increased 3 percent to $2.1 billion.Tan said the rise in wireless division sales were driven by the increasing number of chips the company is contributing to new devices from a ??large North American smartphone customer?? -- taken to be a reference to Apple. Broadcom's CEO expects the wireless business to continue to improve in the current period, he said on the conference call.Tan's acquisitions have lifted the chipmaker's annual revenue from $2.5 billion in 2013 to about seven times that amount in the latest fiscal year. His most-recent deal, the purchase of Brocade Communications, was completed in mid-November.The company is sticking to its long-term target of 5 percent annual sales growth while predicting it will be more profitable than previously thought. Broadcom is aiming for a gross margin, the percentage of sales remaining after deducting costs of production, of 65 percent, 5 percentage points higher that it had expected. Gross margin in the just-reported quarter was 63 percent.Broadcom has shown it can integrate its takeover targets and produce strong earnings, said David Heger, an analyst at Edward Jones. ??They certainly know how to get costs out of acquired business and ramp margins,?? he said.Net income in the period ended Oct. 29 was $671 million, or $1.50 a share, compared with a loss of $668 million, or $1.59, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.59, compared with analysts' average projection of $4.52. Revenue rose 17 percent to $4.84 billion, just beating analysts' estimates."

Greg Jenner, a partner at law firm Stoel Rives LLP, said in an email Monday. ""It's a question of how bad it will be.""Tax lawyers such as Jenner are still unraveling the implications of the compromise bill that was released late on Friday. Renewable-energy proponents initially exhaled after the bill reworked a provision in the Senate bill that threatened to disrupt the industry's $12 billion tax-equity market. The compromise version of the bill would allow companies to offset as much as 80 percent of their foreign-transaction tax with renewable-energy credits.Most solar and wind developers get tax credits for their projects using the investment tax credit or production tax credit, respectively. Because those developers often don't have a large tax liability, third parties such as banks or insurance companies will invest in a renewable project, effectively in exchange for the credits.The consternation is over the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, or BEAT, which was included in the Senate bill. The provision is meant to close loopholes for multinational companies -- including banks and insurers -- that make payments to overseas affiliates.??We are grateful to our champions in Congress for their work to craft a pro-business tax reform bill that will continue the success story of American wind power,?? Tom Kiernan, the chief executive officer of the American Wind Energy Association, said in a statement Monday. A number of details in that reworked proposal could threaten the usefulness of that tax credit, Jenner and other lawyers say.First, the compromise would expand which companies would be subject to the BEAT tax. A company that makes 3 percent of its deductible payments to a foreign affiliate falls under the provision, down from 4 percent in the Senate bill. It's even lower -- 2 percent -- for banks.Second, because these companies won't know if they face a BEAT tax bill, they may be unwilling  to do a tax-equity deal with a renewable developer.Third,?that 80 percent offset expires in 2025, so wind projects in particular, may have their production tax credit curtailed over time.Separately, because the overall corporate tax rate will be cut to 21 percent, there may be less demand for renewable tax credits.All of this means there is great uncertainty now in the future of this $12 billion tax-equity market.""It creates a lot of questions even as it solves some,"" said Greg Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy. ""The BEAT program will make it harder to use the tax credits -- even though it's significantly improved from what we were presented with?? in the Senate, he said.Read More: Wind and Solar Get 80 Percent of What They WantedThere are at least $3 billion ""in investments that are currently on hold,""?John Marciano, partner at law firm Akin Gump Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP in Washington, wrote in a report. ""This could affect $100 billion of power investments in the next ten years.""The BEAT restrictions may prompt ??a few banks?? to drop out early in 2018, but the revisions to the provision should be enough to keep most investors in the market,?said Keith Martin, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP in Washington. The bigger impact according to Martin: projects will likely have to rely less on tax-equity financing under the new plan. Today, tax-equity covers as much as 60 percent of wind-project costs and up to 50 percent of solar-project costs, he said.To be sure, the overall bill, which Congress is expected to send to President Donald Trump this week, includes major wins for the renewable industries, including nixing a House provision to reduce the value of the wind industry's tax credit and eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax. Just like other companies, developers will have their main tax rate cut and will get to write off the expense of equipment immediately, rather than having it depreciate over time, Martin wrote.""The ultimate outcome may be very situational depending on investor,"" said Timothy Fox, a vice president at the consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners LLC. ""Renewable power advocates may not be completely happy with this language, but we suspect they may be sighing a sigh of relief."""

He says it was menial labor, but it kept food on the table. ??Hunt, kill, click, repeat,?? he says?as his paladin hacks?and slashes?minotaurs, just playing for fun. ??But if you'd give me a 10-megabyte connection or a job, I'll stay home with the internet.????Venezuela's internet connection speeds are among the slowest in the world??the country scored worse than?war-torn Syria?in a?2017 ranking of 159 countries.?So many gold farmers?work night shifts to avoid heavy traffic. Pe?a's wife, Ruth Villegas, 37, who was whiling away some time at Mona Pizza with their 6-year-old daughter, says she used to regard her husband's nocturnal gaming as?a?nuisance because it?kept her up at night. ??We'd get into ugly fights, and he would tell me: ??I'll leave you before I give up Tibia,'?? she recalls. ??But I can't argue with what he's making.??There are often times when the means of production disappears altogether. A rash of copper-wire thefts in Caracas took down the internet in some neighborhoods and prevented Samuel Navas, a 28-year-old sometime-insurance salesman, from logging onto Tibia for the past two months. That cost him almost two-thirds of his income and turned his wife into family's breadwinner. ???As man of the house I should be paying the bills,?? he says, ??but suddenly everything goes beyond your control.??The gold farmers are scorned by many first-world players and the developers of the games, who say the practice is unsporting and distorts the value of digital currencies.?Publishers of the games also say it breaks their terms of service and encourages illegal activities such as account hijacking and credit?card fraud. Mathew Kemp, a senior project manager at Jagex?in Cambridge, England, ?the developer of RuneScape, said the company bans about 10,000 accounts a day. ??If we were to allow gold farming it would destroy the game,'' he said in an email.?Romer Manuel Pe?a's team?of gold farmers has been banned several times from RuneScape, forcing them to start over and spend weeks nurturing new characters before generating income. The 27-year-old, who used to work as an oil engineer in Venezuela's central plains,?contends his team members are simply trying to get by, and Jagex should support them. ??Shouldn't they be proud that entire families are being fed by their game?'' he says.But anger at the influx of farmers in games such as?RuneScape is such that one user of the Reddit online forum posted a guide to ??Killing Venezuelans?? (since removed) that offered tips on eliminating their characters.Venezuelan gold farmers' biggest enemy may prove not to be xenophobic gamers, but themselves. That's because as more players flock to the online worlds to make a living, they ultimately drive down the price of digital gold. ??They're printing money,'' says?Vili Lehdonvirta, an economic sociologist at Oxford University who studies digital marketplaces. ??Essentially what results is hyperinflation, as there is lots more currency coming into the system.''"

Having a U.K.-specific regulatory framework could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds in costs being duplicated as companies seek to comply with a new set of rules.??REACH is far from perfect but it is our belief that the best way of minimizing any disruption to supply chains?? is maintaining the status quo, Elliott said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg.The chemical industry's concerns mirror those of the aerospace industry, which called for continued membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency.With the clock ticking down to Brexit in March 2019, May is having to tread a fine line to balance the competing demands of industry and so-called hard-Brexit supporters in her cabinet, such as Gove, who want few compromises in any deal. Other players she's contending with include her divided backbenchers, the EU, bloc member Ireland and the Northern Irish party that props up her government."
Taxes on Meat Could Join Carbon and Sugar to Help Limit Emissions,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/taxes-on-meat-seen-joining-carbon-sugar-to-help-limit-emissions,"December 11, 2017, 11:32 AM EST",climate-changed,"""The idea has met resistance over fears of political backlash"", ""Tyson invests in plant-based burger backed by Gates, DiCaprio""","Move over, taxes on carbon and sugar: the global levy that may be next is meat.Some investors are betting governments around the world will find a way to start taxing meat production as they aim to improve public health and hit emissions targets set in the Paris Climate Agreement. Socially focused investors are starting to push companies to diversify into plant protein, or even suggest livestock producers use a ??shadow price?? of meat -- similar to an internal carbon price -- to estimate future costs.Meat could encounter the same fate as tobacco, carbon and sugar, which are currently taxed in 180, 60, and 25 jurisdictions around the world, respectively, according to a report Monday from investor group the FAIRR (Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return) Initiative. Lawmakers in Denmark, Germany, China and Sweden have discussed creating livestock-related taxes in the past two years, though the idea has encountered strong resistance.Greenhouse gas emissions from livestock are about 14.5 percent of the world's total, according to the Food & Agriculture Organization, which projects global meat consumption to increase 73 percent by mid-century, amid growing demand from economies like India and China. That could result in as much as $1.6 trillion in health and environmental costs for the global economy by 2050, according to FAIRR, a London-based initiative created by Coller Capital.??Investors are starting to consider this in a similar way to how they have considered climate risk,?? said Rosie Wardle, who manages investor engagements at FAIRR. ??It's kind of accepted now that we need to address livestock production and consumption to meet that 2 degree global warming limit.??The Guardian newspaper reported on the FAIRR report earlier Monday.FAIRR's sustainable protein engagement plan, currently supported by 57 investors with $2.3 trillion under management, plans to ask 16 major food multinationals this year to ??future proof?? their supply chains by diversifying their protein sources.The possible impact of a meat tax could be similar to sugar taxes. While sugar taxes aimed at fighting obesity in the U.S. have faced some resistance, similar levies have been implemented in 18 countries and six U.S. cities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. When Mexico imposed a special tax in 2014 on sugary drinks,?it lowered per capita consumption of those beverages by 6 percent in 2014, 8 percent in 2015 and 11 percent in the first half of 2016, according to Mexico's National Institute of Public Health.The idea of taxing meat has been hamstrung by fears of creating a political backlash by taxing farmers, FAIRR said in the report.Plant protein, however, is already capturing a sizable amount of demand for protein, pushed partially by millennials and a trend toward incorporating more vegetarian food into Western diets. About 4 in 10 Americans and Canadians are actively trying to incorporate more plant-based food into their diets, according to a Nielsen Co. global survey.A venture capital fund owned by Tyson Foods Inc., made its second investment last week in Beyond Meat, which creates a plant-based burger that's also backed by billionaire Bill Gates and Leonardo DiCaprio and sold in thousands of U.S. grocery stores and restaurants. Tyson took an initial 5 percent stake in the burger creator last year. Green Century Capital Management asked the poultry powerhouse in an August 2016 shareholder proposal to explore more plant-based protein opportunities. Tyson started work on the Beyond Meat deal several months before receiving the proposal amid growing??consumer interest in all forms of protein,?? said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for the Springdale, Arkansas-based company. ""Besides all of the risks that are in the meat industry, where you are talking about huge amounts of emissions and water pollution, this is about diversifying and figuring out what areas can lead to growth,"" Marissa LaFave, shareholder advocate at Boston-based Green Century, said in an interview.The firm, which oversees about $500 million, plans to introduce more plant-based proposals at food companies this year, according to LaFave, who said companies including General Mills Inc., Campbell Soup Co., Unilever NV, Kraft Heinz Co., Kellogg Co. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. are already introducing more plant-based food. Danone SA agreed to acquire WhiteWave Foods, a top maker of nut and soy milks, for a 23 percent premium last year, and said in July that the acquisition is expected to help sales.Tyson, which described itself for years as a producer and marketer of chicken, beef and pork, is quickly recasting its image. The company now calls itself ??one of the world's largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein.??"
Microsoft Intern's Rape Claim Highlights Struggle to Combat Sex Discrimination,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/microsoft-intern-s-rape-claim-highlights-struggle-to-combat-sex-discrimination,"December 14, 2017, 12:58 PM EST",technology,,"The woman was an intern when her Microsoft colleagues took her out for drinks in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. She lived miles away in Redmond, the home to Microsoft's suburban campus, so after a night of drinking, she crashed with a male intern and his friend who lived in a group house nearby. She fell asleep in the basement, while the other intern and his friend played guitar.But during the night, her lawyer would later write to Microsoft, the male intern sexually assaulted her??or ??forcibly penetrated her while she was sleeping,?? according to her lawyer's letter. When she woke, naked and with just flashes of memory, she rushed to the hospital for a rape exam and later filed a police report. She reported the incident to her supervisor at Microsoft as well as the company's human resources department, which promised a prompt investigation.In the meantime, she was required to keep working alongside the man. When she discussed getting a restraining order with Microsoft, HR told her if she wanted one, she'd need to change teams, her lawyer wrote. She liked the work and her boss, so she stayed put for the rest of the summer. Microsoft later offered her a full-time job.And despite the allegations against him, Microsoft also hired her accused rapist.The company assured her she wouldn't be located near the man, nor would they have to work together, her lawyer wrote. She took the job and signed a one-year lease for housing, even though she was still waiting to hear about the investigation.The intern told her story in a February 2014 settlement letter to Microsoft, part of a trove of internal files unsealed Nov. 29 in a two-year-old class action lawsuit alleging gender discrimination at Microsoft. The documents shed new light on the company's struggle to deal with reports of harassment and on internal debates over whether women were treated fairly. While personal information such as names, dates and departments are largely redacted, the confidential files detail harassment complaints made by company veterans, incidents investigated by human resources, and internal skepticism over the equal pay data Microsoft publicizes. That the stories are seeing the light of day is remarkable, given the numerous legal hurdles many companies use to keep employee complaints under wraps.A Microsoft representative said in a statement that the company works ??hard to create a safe work environment for every employee.?? The company said that while the intern's alleged incident didn't occur at work, it took her claims ??very seriously,?? and its security and investigations team met with her. ??We encouraged her to take her complaint to law enforcement, and offered to connect her with additional resources such as victim advocacy groups,?? the spokesperson said, adding that Microsoft also took ??practical steps to address concerns she had about her safety.??The personal stories, along with expert reports, have emerged in a case brought by three female employees in 2015 alleging systemic disparities in the pay and promotion of women in technical and engineering roles at Microsoft. As part of the court process to share evidence in the case, Microsoft had to give the women's lawyers at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP and Outten & Golden LLP more than 150,000 internal documents, including several allegations of harassment and assault, like the intern's letter.??I don't think companies are motivated to truly change their internal culture ?? until they are publicly held accountable??The current wave of sexual harassment allegations against influential companies and powerful men has prompted scrutiny on the legal tools that have limited how women can go public in cases like these. When employees are hired, their contracts increasingly include what are known as pre-dispute arbitration clauses, which say that employees can't sue the company in court. When accusers resolve their complaints in private, through arbitration or a settlement, there usually is no public disclosure or record. And the terms of settlements regularly include non-disparagement clauses and non-disclosure agreements, which prevent employees from saying anything negative about the company or even acknowledging a settlement exists. For those cases that do make it to court, companies fight to keep the most damaging records sealed.??I don't think companies are motivated to truly change their internal culture when there are issues until they are publicly held accountable,?? says Erin Pulaski, an employment attorney at Rudy Exelrod Zieff & Lowe, the San Francisco law firm that represented Ellen Pao, a venture capitalist who brought a landmark gender-discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Pao lost the suit in 2015.The Microsoft intern's allegations are public??whether or not she wanted them to be??because of a rare confluence of events. While about two-thirds of workers at large employers have signed mandatory arbitration agreements, they are not standard at Microsoft. The plaintiffs requested Microsoft turn over individual complaints, and an NDA doesn't necessarily prevent an employer from disclosing those documents in court, even if it would have prohibited a woman from telling her own story publicly. The letter on behalf of the former intern, for example, included a proposed settlement for severance, and in exchange offered ??a full and complete mutual release.?? Details about how things worked out for the intern weren't included in the disclosures. Her attorney, Robin Williams Phillips, didn't respond to several requests for comment, and a search of court records found no cases brought by Phillips against Microsoft. The company spokesperson said, ??We don't and we won't allow non-disclosure agreements to become a tool to enable those who engage in such conduct to continue with this type of wrongdoing.??This October, the women bringing the lawsuit filed a motion to have their class certified on behalf of more than 8,600 other women. They attached as evidence individual allegations, including the intern's; some of Microsoft's internal communications; and the plaintiffs' own expert data analysis. The documents were originally sealed, but after the plaintiffs objected Microsoft allowed some of them to be unsealed and is still fighting over others.Much of the dispute over what internal information the plaintiffs could have and disclose centered on an internal study of equal pay that Microsoft publicly touted. To mark Equal Pay Day in 2016, Microsoft published a blog post declaring that for every $1 paid to men at the company, women of the same job title and level were paid 99.7 cents. Not equal but pretty close, the company emphasized.In court, though, Microsoft argued that it shouldn't need to reveal the underlying data and communications about the study, saying it fell under various legal confidentiality rules. In June, a neutral arbiter??known as a special master??appointed by the judge for these types of disputes recommended that the company disclose more details to the plaintiffs. ??Fundamental fairness,?? the special master wrote, ??suggests that Microsoft should not be allowed to publicly tout its favorable diversity data, including providing statistics on its success, and then claim the data and resulting method to reach its statistics are privileged.????The real disparities, as we know, are in hiring, promotion, leadership positions, and representation in non-traditional roles??The documents recently unsealed by Microsoft include a deeply skeptical internal response to the software maker's announcement on pay equality. Some of the documents indicate that the move backfired, generating a wave of employee concerns, indignation and even accusations the company wasn&apos;t taking the issue seriously.Comments to Microsoft's executive vice president of human resources, Kathleen Hogan, derided the study, pointing out that it ignored how women had a harder time progressing to higher-paid positions. ??Without that data, I view this as a vanity metric,?? one employee wrote. Another told Hogan: ??While I understand the desire to focus on the positive when reporting numbers, I think it&apos;s virtually meaningless that people in the same level with the same job title have nearly equal salaries. The real disparities, as we know, are in hiring, promotion, leadership positions, and representation in non-traditional roles.??There were other missteps that indicated the company was struggling with its approach to improving gender equality. In 2014, at a conference promoting women in technology, then-new Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella advised women not to directly ask for raises, but instead to keep silent and rely on the ??karma?? of hard work to reward them. Criticism was immediate, and Nadella swiftly apologized. The women filed their class action lawsuit the following year.While he was saying sorry, Nadella also said equal pay wasn&apos;t enough if women didn&apos;t have opportunities to do equal work. But Microsoft is still fighting to keep its own data on diversity and gender equity private, as well as top-line numbers on harassment and discrimination complaints to HR and how they were resolved. It did agree to unseal statistical analyses, conducted by the plaintiffs' experts, including one by Princeton University economics professor Henry Farber. Farber found that women in engineering and IT operations at Microsoft, through the first nine levels in the company hierarchy, were paid 8.6 percent less than their male peers.??We have a strong commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workforce where all employees have the chance to succeed,?? Microsoft said in its statement. ??While we've made important progress over the years including increasing diverse representation and expanding training, we are constantly learning and working to improve. We've reviewed the plaintiffs' claims and strongly disagree with the contentions in the case because data and other information is mischaracterized.??Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Microsoft investor Arjuna Capital, which has used shareholder proposals to push Microsoft and other companies to publicly disclose pay equity data, says there's every reason for Microsoft to be more forthcoming, despite the potentially unflattering results.??We have this society-wide gender gap, and compensation has been locked up in a black box,?? she says. ??Women think that they're being underpaid, and so you need to prove that they're not and that's how you're going to remain competitive and keep that female talent.????We took the action we deemed appropriate related to the accused employee??Once she became a full-time employee, the intern discovered she'd be working in the same building as the man she said raped her, and later, after a reorganization, would need to be on the same team??a situation her lawyer called ??alarming.?? She stopped taking a Microsoft internal shuttle bus after seeing him try to take the same shuttle. When she later asked HR about their investigation, the letter says, she was told that because the police didn't charge the man, Microsoft dropped the case. ??It is unfathomable that Microsoft would hire [an] individual against whom a criminal complaint of rape had been made by a co-employee,?? her lawyer wrote. An employer's responsibility ??to keep a safe, hostile-free work environment is not premised on whether a harasser can be criminally charged,?? the lawyer said.Police deem only about 5 percent of rape cases to be baseless, according to a 2015 analysis of federal data by the nonprofit investigative newsroom ProPublica, but many complaints don't result in charges. Without a criminal case, an employer still must decide how to handle the accused. ??Law enforcement did not ultimately file any charges,?? the company spokesperson said. ??Given this, and our own findings, we took the action we deemed appropriate related to the accused employee. We continued to work with the employee who raised the complaint to provide support.???? With assistance by Peter Blumberg"

Stitch Fix Shares Tumble After First Earnings Report,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/stitch-fix-is-spending-more-for-customer-growth-shares-tumble,"December 19, 2017, 4:56 PM EST",technology,"""Costs rise as personal styling service expands categories"", ""Company projects sales that would beat analysts' estimates""","Stitch Fix Inc., the data-driven online personal-styling service,?had its biggest decline since becoming a public company after reporting that it's spending more money than analysts expected to expand into new apparel categories.Expenses in the fiscal first quarter, which ended in October, rose 43 percent to $119.5 million on higher advertising and hiring costs, Stitch Fix said Tuesday in its first earnings report following a November initial public offering. Gross margins also narrowed from a year earlier, in large part due to new product lines for men and plus-sized women, the company said.?The shares fell as much as 17 percent Wednesday morning and were down 7.8 percent to $22.83 at 9:49 a.m. in New York.??Men's and Plus are drags on the business,?? Chief Executive Officer Katrina Lake said in a phone interview. ??These investments are important for long-term growth. The price that we're choosing to pay is in short-term profitability.??Stitch Fix started as an online subscription company for women's clothing, capitalizing on a spike in consumer interest in recurring boxes of various goodies. Lake focused on collecting data and using it to tailor the boxes to customers' tastes in fashion. The company has since expanded to multiple categories to appeal to a broader customer base and is working to focus more sales around specific events, like date nights. While many other subscription box companies faltered, Stitch Fix gained ground in part by offering more flexible options and on-demand deliveries.The company had about 2.4 million active clients as of the end of October, a 30 percent gain from a year earlier. Each new category adds potential customers that Stitch Fix could reach, with men's boxes doubling the company's potential market in the U.S., Chief Operating Officer Mike Smith said on a conference call.?Customers only pay for the articles of clothing they keep and send back what they don't want. Stitch Fix employs about 3,400 stylists who -- helped by software that sifts through data and comes up with recommendations -- figure out what each box of clothes should contain.While the company doesn't break down clients by category, Smith said that within six months of launching men's boxes, male customers on average bought an equivalent number of items per delivery as female customers. Stitch Fix also had a waiting list of more than 75,000 women for plus-sized apparel boxes prior to the category's launch in February, he said.The company also plans to expand inventory in apparel priced in the $20 to $50 range -- lower price points than its traditional assortment. While that will result in a lower average order value, it's another category that significantly widens the potential client base and has resulted in better retention, Lake said.Stitch Fix is still in its proving stage. It had a rocky start with an initial public offering last month that was met with a tepid response from investors. The company, which combines big data and traditional retail, shrunk the offering size and cut the price to $15 a share from as much as $20, raising less than it planned. On its first day of trading, shares ended only 1 percent higher.Since then, however, the stock had risen 65 percent through Tuesday. Analysts are now generally positive on the company, which has no sell ratings.The early success in customer satisfaction and purchasing habits shows the company's effort to spend on expanding its fashion categories is worth the investment, Smith said. And over time, Stitch Fix expects better gross margins from the new categories as they grow -- similar to how the main women's business became more profitable with size.Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the current quarter will be $11.5 million to $15.5 million, the San Francisco-based company said. Analysts on average expected $15.5 million.Revenue will be $287 million to $294 million in the period. Analysts projected $286.3 million. The company forecast annual sales of $1.17 billion to $1.22 billion, compared with estimates of $1.18 billion.Net income was $13.5 million, or 4 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter, from $13.2 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier. Sales gained 25 percent to $295.6 million in the three months ended Oct. 28.Stitch Fix is atypical in that it has been profitable and has a clean balance sheet. It had gross margins of 44 percent in 2017, an unusual feat when many consumer startups struggle to break even.Lake, who founded Stitch Fix in 2011, was the only female tech chief executive officer to take a company public in 2017. She also only raised $42 million before going public, despite having an operations-heavy business requiring its own fulfillment centers.Critics have questioned whether Stitch Fix will be able to continue growing its customer base. Its business model is to collect?information on a customer's style, size and price preference and send them five pieces of clothing for a $20 styling fee.

Now they're preparing for battle in Washington to protect their industry's ascent.?Advocacy groups are gearing up in Washington for a lobbying push in 2018, looking to limit legislation that would subject cryptocurrencies to more regulation and change tax-reporting requirements. Organizations such as the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Coin Center Inc. and the Bitcoin Foundation?say they're concerned about stifling innovation.?Their top targets include a Senate bill that would include digital currency in an update of money-laundering laws, requiring more entities to police potentially illicit transactions. Some advocates are also backing a House bill that would exempt crypto transactions of up to $600 from capital-gains tax reporting.The lobbying comes after bitcoin skyrocketed past $17,000 this year and debuted on Wall Street with a new breed of futures contracts. While many in the financial industry predict it's just a matter of time until regulators subject cryptocurrencies to stiffer regulation, proponents argue that over-regulation would be akin to impeding the rise of the internet.Read more: JPMorgan's CEO predicts governments will ??come down' on bitcoin??This technological innovation must be allowed to develop, be rolled out and tested in real environments without material interference or overburdening regulations, especially at the initial stages of its adoption,?? Llew Claasen, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit advocacy group, wrote in a Nov. 30 letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee.The committee is considering anti-money laundering legislation that would deploy new tools and close loopholes to undercut terrorism financing, counterfeiting and other criminal activity, Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a prepared statement for a Nov. 28 hearing.The bill includes a section that would expand the definition of ??financial institution?? to include an issuer, redeemer or cashier of ??digital currency?? and ??any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.?? That would require bitcoin handlers to report suspicious transactions and shoulder the same anti-money laundering obligations that banks have as law enforcers raise concerns about digital currencies being used in illegal activity.The Bitcoin Foundation is pressing the committee to remove the section on cryptocurrencies from the Senate bill or limit the language to digital currency exchanges. Applying the provisions to issuers of digital currency is misguided and the burden of compliance would be greater than the benefit from developing the technology in the U.S., the foundation said.Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy organization in Washington, has met with members of Congress and their staff about the bill to argue that while the policy goals make sense, the language as drafted isn't needed,?said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research.?The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which tracks illicit payments, issued adequate guidance in 2013 for people using virtual currencies. The language should either be removed or the FinCEN guidance incorporated, he said.?The Chamber of Digital Commerce, a Washington-based trade association comprised of more than 130 companies representing the digital asset and blockchain industry, agrees the language is unnecessary. It's also sent a statement to the committee and met with staff,?said Amy Kim,?the chamber's global policy director and general counsel.??Dianne FeinsteinA spokesman for Grassley?didn't respond to email and telephone requests for comment about the concerns.?Ashley Schapitl, a spokeswoman for Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said the senator is working with the Justice and Treasury departments to get technical assistance as the bill moves forward.While some people may have concerns there's not enough regulation, it's less of an issue in the U.S. than in other jurisdictions, said Yaya Fanusie, director of analysis for the?Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.?The best thing lawmakers can do is consult the cryptocurrency industry when drafting new legislation or regulation to better understand it, and to be very clear about what definitions are used, Fanusie said.???You have to be very precise because we're talking about a new industry and new terminology,?? he said.?Making Sense of Bitcoin and Its Wild Price Ride: QuickTake Q&AA bipartisan bill introduced in September, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act of 2017, is also needed to bolster consumer confidence, said Representative Jared Polis, a Democrat from Colorado and a co-sponsor of the measure with Arizona Republican David Schweikert.

"IBM Taps Samsung, JPMorgan, Daimler in Quantum Computing Push",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/ibm-taps-samsung-jpmorgan-daimler-in-quantum-computing-push,"December 14, 2017, 12:01 AM EST",technology,,"International Business Machines Corp. has signed up several prominent banks as well as industrial and technology companies to start experimenting with its quantum computers.JPMorgan Chase & Co.?and Barclays Bank Plc?are among the 12 organizations?IBM selected to get early-access to its latest quantum computing technology, which could eventually?help solve difficult problems that are beyond the reach of any conventional supercomputer.Automakers Daimler AG and Honda Motor Co., technology giant Samsung Electronics Co., chemicals companies?JSR Corp. and Nagase?& Co., specialty materials company Hitachi Metals Ltd. are also in the group. Many of the most promising potential applications for quantum computers involve creating new chemical catalysts or engineering new materials with exotic properties.IBM is competing with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Canadian company D-Wave Systems Inc. and California-based?Rigetti?Computing as well as a number of other small start-ups to commercialize the technology. Many of these companies plan to offer access to quantum computers through their cloud computing networks and?see it as a future selling point.For now,?quantum computers still remain too small and the error rates in calculations are?too high for the machines to be useful for most real-world applications.IBM will give the companies it has selected for its early access program, called?the?Q Network, access to a 20-qubit?quantum computer through the cloud. While such a computer?can theoretically perform more than?1 million simultaneous calculations, that compares to classically designed supercomputers that?can perform tens of thousands of trillions of calculations per second. What's more, quantum computers like IBM's can't make calculations without accruing errors that can make its results useless for many practical applications.??By giving the companies access to quantum computers, however, IBM is banking on hooking them early on the emerging technology so that when more powerful machines are ready the companies will already be comfortable with the systems.IBM?has also recently?tested?a prototype of a 50-qubit?quantum computer ?C?which is approaching a threshold known as ??quantum supremacy,???where it may be able to perform calculations that are beyond the reach of a classical supercomputer. But it?still produces errors. IBM said it would let the companies in its early access program begin experimenting with this size machine through the cloud in the near future.JPMorgan said?it would partner with IBM to explore whether quantum computers can be used for trading strategies, portfolio optimization, asset pricing and risk analysis.Daimler said it would investigate how quantum computers might help it perfect its manufacturing processes, route fleets of self-driving cars or help the company develop new materials for automobiles.Samsung said it would be looking at what impact quantum computing might have on semiconductors, while JSR said it would research chemical and material applications.Classical computers work using tiny transistors imprinted on silicon chips. They process information in a binary format, either a 0 or 1, called?bits. Instead of bits, quantum computers use qubits, which can represent both a 0 and 1 simultaneously and?give quantum computers much more power than classical computers.But they are prone to errors and must be cooled to temperatures below those found in outer space.?Microsoft is working on a different type of qubit?that will theoretically produce?a lower error rate,?making it more useful for commercial applications. But the company has not yet managed to build a working model.IBM and the other companies in the race to commercialize the technology, however, have begun offering customers simulators that demonstrate what a quantum computer might be able to do without errors. This enables?companies to begin thinking?about how they will design applications for these machines. In some cases, like machine learning, quantum-inspired algorithms have helped companies improve the efficiency of the software they run on standard computers.Other participants in the IBM's?Q Network?include the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S., Keio University in Japan, the University of Oxford, in the U.K., and the University of Melbourne, in Australia."
China Sets Out Scaled-Back Vision for Biggest Carbon Market,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/china-unveils-plan-for-world-s-biggest-carbon-trading-market,"December 19, 2017, 3:37 AM EST",climate-changed,"""Initial program will be limited to the nation's power sector"", ""System to cover 1,700 companies at first, will be expanded""","China?set out a scaled-back vision to create the world's biggest financial market aimed at limiting pollution in a move that signals its backing for the fight against climate change.The government in Beijing said Tuesday it's working on a carbon emissions trading system that will cover 1,700 utilities. That's fewer than the 6,000 companies across a range of industries authorities were considering for inclusion as recently as a year ago. Policymakers also stopped short of naming a date for trading to begin.President Xi Jinping's administration is moving cautiously in designing a system that essentially forces companies to pay for permits to pollute. It's seeking to balance demands to clear up smog with the forecasts for galloping electricity demand from factories and homes, which will require construction of dozens of new coal-fired pants.??After several false starts and shifting priorities and nervousness around whether or not carbon speculation will make policy enforcement difficult, the regulators have decided to be even more cautious about the market deployment,?? said Sophie Lu, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in Beijing.Even a smaller carbon market in China would mark a significant advance for involving markets in limiting pollution, an idea that gained currency two decades ago with the Kyoto Protocol. It prompted Europe to start a carbon market in 2005 and the U.S., under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, to work toward a system of carbon pricing that ultimately was rejected by the Senate.?The European Union endorsed China's move, saying it showed the world is moving toward tighter restrictions on fossil-fuel pollution even as President Donald Trump works to stimulate coal use in the U.S.??As the U.S. government turns its back on the fight against climate change, China, the EU and many others are forging ahead,?? EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said in a statement from Brussels. ??With both the EU and China committed to emissions trading, two major international players are championing carbon markets.??China's market would bring about a quarter of the world's emissions under some kind of trading system. It would cover more carbon pollution than the EU's market, whose yearly allowances are currently valued at 14 billion euros ($16.5 billion) a year.The key provisions of China's program announced by the National Development and Reform Commission are:Industry executives and environmental analysts have called for carbon prices of at least 30 euros a ton to prompt a rapid movement toward cleaner forms of energy. Even so, the complexity of calculating how much pollution should be allowed and when charges should kick in has bedeviled authorities managing carbon markets from the start, and prices in Europe have averaged well below 10 euros for the past five years.The Paris Agreement on climate change injected fresh momentum into the global fight?against climate change two years ago, bringing together almost 200 countries in a pledge to limit fossil-fuel pollution everywhere for the first time. Xi and Obama worked together on that deal. China's announcement on Tuesday is another sign that the government there remains committed to the effort even though Trump isn't.China's system will adopt a cap-and-trade rule in which the biggest corporate polluters purchase credits from those that don't emit as much. Companies are encouraged to reduce their emissions so they can sell unused allocations.The carbon market will make it easier for China to attract investment because the system would help ensure clean investments have a strong competitive position against fossil fuels, said Mark Brownstein, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund who specializes in energy and climate.??You've gotta get the pricing right to get the investment,?? he said by phone. ??People are going to be surprised at how aggressively China moves to transition to natural gas over coal, how quickly it will move toward an electric-vehicle fleet and how readily it will continue to deploy renewable energy.??The EU was the first to require carbon permits, in 2005, only to see the price plunge?in part because participating nations handed out too many allowances for free. Australia repealed its carbon tax in 2014 and scrapped plans for permit trading after the measures were blamed for destroying jobs. But carbon markets in various forms are in place in California, New Zealand and South Korea, where they're attempting to learn from each other's mistakes.China has been running pilot programs since 2013 in some regions, where transaction values totaled 4.5 billion yuan ($680 million) as of September, Li Gao, an official of the climate-change department at the NDRC, said at a briefing in October. The agency said Tuesday that companies that qualify for the national system will stop participating in the pilot projects.Li said China has yet to determine how it will allocate permits to industry and will also work on building registration and trading systems for the market. China will allocate quotas to its power industry using a reference-line method under which companies that have better management and lower emissions will be given more quotas, said Jiang Zhaoli, deputy director of the climate change division at the NDRC.??

The Amazon-Whole Foods Deal Is Turning Out to Be Good for Delivery Startups,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/whole-foods-deal-provides-improbable-boost-to-delivery-startups,"December 12, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",business,"""Industry response to Amazon's takeover has fueled growth"", ""Shipt expects $1 billion in revenue as food sales move online""","When Amazon.com Inc.?acquired Whole Foods as part of its attack on the supermarket industry, it looked like a crushing blow for grocery-delivery startups like Shipt Inc. and?Instacart Inc.If consumers could get their food from Amazon, why would they need a separate delivery service? But rather than make the startups obsolete, the Whole Foods deal helped raise their profile. Grocery chains across the U.S. have enlisted the two companies to help them set up delivery operations, viewing them as key allies in the defense against Amazon.Shipt Chief Executive Officer Bill Smith has watched it unfold from Birmingham, Alabama, where he founded the startup in 2014. Amazon's Whole Foods takeover was a wake-up call for supermarket chains, he said, and business began picking up after the transaction was announced in June.??It was a slow-and-steady approach before the deal, but I think now they know they have to be aggressive,?? Smith, 32, said in an interview. ??The deal moved partnering with companies like us to the forefront.??Shipt has seen its orders surge 60 percent since June, and it has pushed into 22 new geographic markets. Next year, the company expects to hit roughly $1 billion in revenue.For years, the grocery industry was insulated from the disruptions of e-commerce, which has hammered other areas of the retail landscape. So far, only about 2 percent of the roughly $800 billion market has shifted online, according to RBC Capital Markets.But the $13.7 billion Whole Foods purchase heralded a new era for the industry. Amazon's knack for supply-chain logistics and customer-data analysis has investors betting that it will eventually master the food business. Along the way, analysts predict that at least 10 percent of grocery sales will move online.The question for traditional supermarkets is how to handle all those internet orders. They could build their own delivery network, but it's an arduous and expensive process, Smith said. That's why many of them are seeking help from e-commerce startups.Shipt and Instacart use a similar model: They partner with retailers, making the items at a particular store available online. Once a customer orders, they send a ??shopper?? into the store to grab the groceries, and then deliver the items. Shipt charges $99 a year for unlimited deliveries.Shipt will end the year in more than 70 U.S. markets, up from 30 in 2016. For Instacart, the growth has been even more rapid. The company is launching in seven new places this week and will finish the year in more than 170 markets, a more-than-fivefold increase from a year earlier.Instacart, based in San Francisco, has a complicated relationship with Amazon. Whole Foods enlisted the company to provide delivery services before the grocery chain was acquired by the e-commerce giant. That's raised questions over whether Whole Foods will still need Instacart in the future.For now, Instacart has a few years left on its contract with Whole Foods, which invested more than $30 million in the startup last year.Kroger, the largest conventional grocer in the U.S., works with both startups. And Albertsons Cos., the industry's No. 2 chain, recently tapped Instacart to provide home delivery at more than 1,800 of its stores by the middle of next year.When Amazon first announced the Whole Foods deal, the move rattled shares of Kroger, which became a symbol of an old industry ripe for a shake-up. But the fears have begun to subside, and Kroger's stock has outpaced Amazon's in the past three months.Shipt has focused on the Southeast and the Midwest, teaming up with well-known regional retailers like Publix Super Markets Inc. and H-E-B Grocery Co. It takes the company about six months to become profitable in a new market, Smith said. By the end of 2018, Shipt expects to be in about 140 markets, including most major cities in the U.S.Wal-Mart Stores Inc., meanwhile, has focused more on curbside pickup -- rather than grocery delivery. It hopes customers will be drawn to the convenience of ordering online but still be willing to drive to stores to get their goods.Smith doesn't think Amazon will do to groceries what it did for books. In other words, there will be plenty of room for multiple companies to thrive.??Amazon is a very good machine, but they haven't been able to crack the code on grocery,?? he said. ??It's a very different business.??Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expects grocery-delivery startups to make further inroads. Even though few Americans are currently getting their food delivered, offering an e-commerce option is seen as a critical marketing tool, she said.??It's almost become a de facto requirement to have it,?? Bartashus said. ??Right now, it's more about perception than reality -- they want to be perceived as contemporary.??For more on Amazon, check out the?Decrypted? podcast:"
Samsung Targets First Half of 2018 for Smart Speaker,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/samsung-is-said-to-target-first-half-of-2018-for-smart-speaker,"December 14, 2017, 12:35 PM EST",technology,"""Company considering undercutting Apple with price around $200"", ""Speaker to run Bixby and focus on sound quality, home devices""","Samsung Electronics Co. is aiming to introduce a smart speaker in the first half of 2018, entering a crowded field of voice-controlled devices from Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc., people briefed on the plans said.The device by the South Korean technology giant will have a strong focus on audio quality and the management of connected home appliances such as lights and locks, said the people, who asked not to be identified talking about private plans.The gadget will run Bixby, Samsung's digital assistant that rivals Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant. It will also synchronize with TVs, Galaxy smartphones and?other Samsung devices, the people also said. Samsung declined to comment.Just like Apple's HomePod is a bulwark in the home, Samsung's speaker will do the same for its ecosystem of devices and services, including SmartThings, which Samsung bought in 2014. It plans to make the device available in multiple markets, potentially including the U.S., and is weighing a price point around $200, the people said.?Amazon's flagship Echo speaker has a list price of $100, while Apple's HomePod, which also has a sound quality focus, will cost $349 when it also goes on sale next year.?Samsung's pricing and release plans are still fluid and may change, the people familiar with the speaker's development said. The company is still working on improving the device's ability to conduct voice-based web searches, one of the people said.Like Apple, Samsung is arriving late to a market that Amazon pioneered and Google soon joined. The speakers themselves don't generate much profit for their manufacturers, but the voice assistants and services that are distributed through the devices are an important battleground over the future of human-computer interaction.?Amazon makes money when people buy from its online store via Alexa on Echo gadgets. Google's speakers extend its lucrative search engine into the home and helps it sells products like its music services. The HomePod will be a hub for Apple to lock in users to its HomeKit smart home platform and will likely help the company increase subscriptions to its own music service.According to Gartner, voice-activated speakers will become a $3.5 billion market by 2021, up from $720 million in 2016. That's dwarfed by the smartphone business. However, many homes are likely to have multiple speakers for different rooms, giving tech companies more access points to lock them into their other services.In August, Samsung executive DJ Koh said the company was working on a smart speaker without sharing details. Patrick Chomet, another Samsung executive who joined last year, is heading the project, a person familiar with the company's work said.One prototype version of the Samsung speaker in testing is between the size of Amazon's latest Echo and the HomePod, one of the people said. The company is considering releasing the speaker in different colors, and the prototype seen had a matte black color. It also, like the HomePod, lacks a screen but lights up on top for limited visual feedback. In the past, Samsung has considered developing a speaker with a touchscreen similar to Amazon's Echo Show, according to the person.?? With assistance by Sam Kim"

Pernia told reporters on Saturday at a forum in Manila, when asked if only Chinese companies would be considered by the government. ??China is in the frontline now because no other country has sounded out or expressed interest to come in.??Duterte,?who has sought warmer ties with Beijing amid a territorial dispute between the two countries, offered China the right to operate in the Southeast Asian nation during bilateral talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last month, Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque said on Nov. 20.Duterte's commitment to open up the sector has prompted local companies such as Philippine Telegraph & Telephone Corp. to start talks with China's two biggest telecommunications provider to help challenge PLDT Inc. and Globe Telecom Inc.'s dominance. The two became the nation's only wireless carriers when the San Miguel Corp. conglomerate sold its nascent wireless phone carrier to those companies for 70 billion pesos ($1.4 billion).The president's order for government agencies to act swiftly to ease foreign-investment limits is a first step toward opening up the telecommunications sector, according to Pernia. ??There's a lot of urgency to this,?? he said, adding that better connectivity was a promise Duterte made during his election campaign."

Many of them will be EVs. While Hyundai's Ioniq and Kia's Soul are the only EVs from their stable at present, the hydrogen-based fuel-cell ix35 and some plug-in hybrids are also on offer.The Korean companies are among manufacturers in a global race to develop vehicles with alternative power trains as countries, led by China, prepare to phase out the use of gasoline and diesel powered cars in their fight against pollution. Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, General Motors Co. and BMW AG have also announced plans to introduce electric vehicles, vowing to spend billions of dollars in their transition away from internal combustion engines.??Hyundai should have become a first mover of EVs, but it is still staying as a fast follower,?? said Kim Phil-soo, a professor of automotive engineering at Daelim University near Seoul. ??Hyundai is late by about three years.??Sales of environment-friendly vehicles at Hyundai and Kia reached 186,000 units in the nine months through September, according to data provided by the company.In September, VW announced?plans to build electric versions of all 300 models in the 12-brand group's lineup by 2030.

Daimler AG plans to release 10 electric vehicles by 2022 while BMW AG plans to offer at least 12 fully electric vehicles by 2025.Even as batteries have established themselves as the way forward in the industry's transformation, Hyundai Motor is still betting on the development of hydrogen-based fuel-cell technology, which is?struggling to gain wider acceptance in the market. The Korean company has entered into talks with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for a partnership to build hydrogen-based engines, which emit nothing but heat and water and none of the gases blamed for global warming.Hyundai Motor is seeking flexibility in its approach to green car development, said Lee.??There are 1,200 battery-powered carmakers in the world, while only three automakers have the technology to produce fuel-cell cars,?? said Lee, who is leading the group's NEV development division. ??We see that the hydrogen car is an ultimate direction but we are not saying we will put everything on it. We will push for both of EV and FCV for now.??'Hyundai plans to start producing a new fuel-cell SUV in March with more than 800 kilometers (497 miles) of driving range under European standards. As for battery-powered cars, the automaker will introduce the electrified Kona SUV with a range of about 400 kilometers next year, while its Genesis brand will release a luxury EV with a range of 500 kilometers after 2021.The Seoul-based maker of models such as the Elantra, Sonata and Tucson has vowed to introduce more SUVs in the U.S. to help stem declining sales.

Solar Is Getting Sick of Being Shunned in Equity Markets,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/canadian-solar-chairman-offers-to-take-panel-maker-private,"December 11, 2017, 7:56 AM EST",climate-changed,"""Canadian Solar chief offering $18.47 for shares he doesn't own"", ""Trina and JA Solar have made similar moves in recent months""","Add?Canadian Solar Inc. to the growing list of panel manufacturers looking to ditch public markets and go private.The company's chief executive officer, Shawn Qu, said Monday he's offering $18.47 in cash for all common shares that he and his wife don't already own. In March, rival Trina Solar Ltd. finished a $1.1 billion privatization deal. JA Solar Holdings Co., the world's third-biggest publicly traded solar manufacturer, agreed last month to be taken private.Consider them the start of what could prove to be a global trend as?solar manufacturers, which have fought somewhat unsuccessfully for years to be valued more in Wall Street's eyes, grapple with high levels of debt and volatility in demand.??Investors in general have struggled to value solar stocks, and now you have the U.S. market up in the air?? because of tax reforms that threaten?the solar industry, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kit Konolige said. ??The point of being in the public markets is you have more financing available on better terms. If you don't have that, what's the point of being public???Since the beginning of 2010, spot prices for solar modules have plummeted 83 percent, averaging just 31.4 cents a watt as of Dec. 6, according to PVinsights pricing data compiled by Bloomberg. The slide, driven largely by more efficient manufacturing and capacity in China, have been squeezing panelmakers' profits, making them increasingly difficult to value.So is the U.S. tax plan that threatens to cripple a tax-equity investment vehicle that the industry has relied on for years to finance projects.For another reason Qu may be trying to take Canadian Solar private, consider Longi Green Energy Technology Co., a silicon wafer maker listed in China that has a market value in excess of $10 billion. Canadian Solar has a market capitalization of about $1 billion.??One answer is Shawn Qu becomes a much richer man,???said Gordon Johnson, an analyst at Axiom Capital Management. ??If I simply delist from the U.S. stock exchange and relist on the Chinese stock exchange, the value of my stock will probably increase substantially.??That could also be the reason Trina went private and JA Solar agreed to -- they're both based in China. Qu grew up?in China and built some of his company's operations there. David Pasquale, a spokesman for Canadian Solar, declined to comment beyond the company's statement on Monday.Motivations aside, Qu's offer price may prove too low to entice shareholders, according to Brad Meikle, a renewable energy analyst at Coker & Palmer Inc. It's below $32 a share, Meikle's estimate for what Canadian Solar is worth, and well below his $45 upside target.Shares of Canadian Solar rose as much as 6.7 percent to $18.40 on Monday before closing at $17.79 in New York. The company's board has formed a special committee of independent and what it described as ??disinterested?? directors to consider the proposal.JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded Canadian Solar to the equivalent of sell from hold and maintained its $15 price target, according to a research note Tuesday.??The stock has traded through our price target and we believe is now likely capped by the CEO's take-private offer of $18.47,?? according to the note. ??We do not believe a higher, competing offer is likely and there could still be risks associated with the deal itself.??There are industrywide implications to Canadian Solar going private, Guggenheim Securities said in a research note late Monday: ??We expect that the move may spur investor expectations of similar acquisitions of other publicly traded?? solar companies.??

Macron's Pick of Encrypted Messaging App Isn't What You Might Expect,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/macron-s-pick-of-encrypted-messaging-app-isn-t-what-you-d-think,"December 12, 2017, 12:00 AM EST",politics,"""Top officials use consumer products for government exchanges"", ""President and advisers started using Telegram in 2016""","French President Emmanuel Macron uses the same encrypted iPhone messaging app once favored by the so-called Islamic State.Telegram Messenger, the chatting software that's backed by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov and attracts consumers with features such as messages that self-destruct, is also the go-to for French officials including the president, people familiar with the matter said.Cryptic Russian Crusader Says His $5 Billion App Can't Be BoughtMacron and his circle of advisers started using Telegram in 2016, in the early days of his bid for the top office, and they've stuck with it for day-to-day exchanges about work planning and practical matters, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private operations.Along with Facebook Inc.'s WhatsApp in some cases, key officials interviewed by Bloomberg News said ease of use, habit and no extra cost are reasons for using Telegram. They also insist on being cautious about the kind of data they share there: only information they say is neither sensitive, classified, nor posing a security risk. Exchanges would otherwise go through high-security hardware like cryptophones specifically built for government, a French official said, asking not to be named as per government policy.A government official said the messaging?services are never used to exchange strategic or confidential information, but only used for logistics and technical information.But even when it's used to discuss seemingly trivial things, there are questions about whether?instant-messaging software made for the greater public is the most appropriate for people running a country. The U.S. debated that matter last year regarding Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, while revelations that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone conversations were tapped?prompted a surge in products and services built to boost telecommunications privacy.Telegram also holds a controversial place in the pantheon of messaging apps that includes WhatsApp, iMessenger and Signal. In October Telegram was fined 800,000 rubles ($14,000) for not providing the Russian Federal Security Service with data necessary to decode messages, Interfax reported citing a court ruling.Islamic State also used the encrypted Telegram Messenger service to connect with supporters, prompting the app to remove multi-user ??channels?? that members complained were promoting the terrorist group.??There's a natural arbitrage between cost, risk and ease of use, depending on the kind of information that's being communicated and the level of potential threats,?? said Herve Debar, a professor at Telecom SudParis and head of the University's networks and telecommunications department. ??In the case of high-level government, it can be difficult for those involved to distinguish sensitive data from information that doesn't need extra protection.??Telegram and Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.While there are times when secrecy is an obvious requirement --things that fall into the utmost confidential categories still warrant using hard copies and physical vaults at France's key posts-- there are also trickier cases. The logistics of the first lady's visit this month to a baby panda at a zoo in the Loire Valley were sorted out over Telegram by government teams, the people said. The data, while trivial to some, could attract unwanted attention insofar as public figures like the president and his spouse are concerned.??Politicians should use certified tools for work communications -- tools that are made by security experts, not companies like Facebook whose business relies on advertising and data collection,?? said Laurent Delaporte, Chief Executive Officer of cybersecurity adviser Akerva.To cater to the privacy needs of government members, but also corporate executives and others handling sensitive data at work, security companies are joining a heap of developers building messaging tools tailored to professionals. They're going after a market already crowded by the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. to Slack Technologies Inc., by trying to differentiate with added security layers.French state-backed defense company Thales SE has an encrypted instant-messaging app called Citadel, which it launched this year and it's been pitching to customers with selling points including the company's military expertise, a seal of approval from France's national cybersecurity agency, and storing data locally. It has added about a dozen paying customers in about a year and has several tens of thousands of users. Some?groups in the French army are currently trying out the software as part of a test phase, according to the defense minister's office.??There's a realization among professionals that there are risks to using free, accessible and fun tools -- they don't know where the data is transiting, where it's stored, or who exactly has access to it,?? said Laurent Duquesne, who started the Citadel project within Thales and is now running it out of the company's startup incubator in Paris."

Others raised concerns about a possible departure of skilled workers and a blow to the country's reputation as an attractive place to carry out research.Johnson & Johnson, in one example, estimated that it could face as many as?50,000 additional tests of its products annually at a cost of almost 1 million pounds ($1.35 million) if there's no mutual recognition of testing between the U.K. and the EU. Merck KGaA cautioned that?post-Brexit tariffs might pose ??significant?? costs for the German company.Without EU membership, U.K. drugmakers may have to pay duties as high as 6.5 percent on exports of products and ingredients, AstraZeneca said. That would cost the Cambridge, England-based company as much as $31 million in annual duties, with the majority being paid to Mediterranean and Asian countries, while its imports to the U.K. could face about $5 million in duties, it said.Drugmakers fear that a Brexit with no deal would mean the U.K. reverts to tariffs set by the World Trade Organization on U.K.-EU trade. Companies would find themselves outside the rules and regulations of the single market that they've built their businesses around for decades."

Two weeks ago he doubled his price target on bitcoin to $11,500 by the middle of 2018. It went for $15,552 as of 10:31 a.m. in New York on Friday, according to Bloomberg composite pricing.He suggests equity managers look to these ideas to leverage blockchain in their portfolios:The looming availability of futures weighed on these equity proxies this week, as speculators may be shifting away from stocks of companies that have benefited as bitcoin's price rose more than 15-fold this year. Both HIVE Blockchain Technologies and U.S. Global Investors are down near 10 percent this week. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have also suffered losses in the five days ending Dec. 8.As for the totality of Lee's picks, an equal weighted basket of these stocks is up 136 percent this year, according to the note.

Group-IB last month signed an agreement with Interpol to share data on threat intelligence and the latest cyber-criminal activities.??Criminals have changed tactics and are now focusing on banks rather than their clients, as was standard operating procedure in the past,?? Dmitry Volkov, the head of Group-IB's cyber intelligence department, said by phone.Russia, considered a hotbed of government-backed information attacks,?increasingly finds itself a victim of cybercrime. It was initially blamed for the Badrabbit ransomware virus that spread to more than 200 targets globally, even though some of the biggest disruptions affected Russian businesses.Since its first successful breach in May 2016, MoneyTaker has stolen from banks in New York, California, Utah and Moscow, primarily targeting smaller institutions with limited cyber defenses, Group-IB found. The average haul from U.S. banks was about $500,000, and it stole over $3 million from three Russian lenders.??They understand that banks -- especially community banks with limited resources -- are the easiest marks,?? Volkov said.The cell remained undetected by using so-called fileless malware that only exists on a computer's temporary memory and destroys itself when the system reboots, meaning it's not permanently stored and therefore can more easily evade anti-virus programs, according to Group-IB. At one bank, the hackers gained access to the network via the home computer of the lender's system administrator.The attackers further covered their tracks with encryption certificates generated using brand names such as Bank of America Corp., Microsoft Corp. and the Federal Reserve, according to Group-IB, which previously uncovered Russian-speaking hacker cells behind the Corkow Trojan and Buhtrap.Microsoft and the Fed couldn't be reached for comment outside of working hours. Swift and?Bank of America didn't immediately respond to requests from Bloomberg.While hackers are transnational, many new types of attacks are discovered in Russia because it's at the forefront of cyber-security, a deputy head of the Russian central bank's information security and protection department, Artem Sychev,?said in an interview in November.Group-IB said the U.S. banks were targeted by gaining access to their card-processing system and then opening accounts at the compromised institutions. The attackers removed limits on the legitimate bank cards and used mules to withdraw cash from ATMs.?The virus was so stealthy that, in at least one instance, a bank was successfully robbed twice.While Group-IB didn't uncover evidence of a successful attack on Swift by MoneyTaker, it found that the hackers were searching for documents related to the messaging system, which could indicate pending attacks. Last year, in one of the biggest heists in cybercrime history, hackers used Swift to steal $81 million from Bangladesh.??The more we dig, the more we'll find,???Group-IB's Volkov said. ??This report doesn't represent the full picture, and I can say with 100 percent certainty that there are more victims that haven't been identified yet.????

In a recent blog post, Intuit Inc.'s TurboTax, which has more than 30 million users, offered advice to consumers who have made money on the rally.??If the bitcoins are held as a capital asset, like stocks or bonds, any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of the asset is taxed as a capital gain or loss,??

Lastly, a taxpayer who mined bitcoins ??must include it in his gross income after determining the fair market dollar value of the virtual currency as of the day he received it,?? TurboTax said, citing the IRS.H&R Block Inc. has an online community forum where people can pose their crypto questions, including what to do after getting bitcoins as a gift. While taxes aren't levied on the value of the gift at the time it's given, the recipient will need to pay taxes on the gains, according to the forum.?For instance, ??boo1207?? asked what to do about the $2,500 of bitcoins they got as a gift and sold for $3,300. ??The $800 gain is your income from this,?? reads the answer from LouisH, who is described as a ??Senior Tax Advisor?? in Florida. ??Because the investment was a gift you do not need to report it on any of your tax returns as gifts are not taxable to the recipient.??That distinction could be important when you're dealing with an asset that's risen about 50 percent this month alone."
Dogged $4 Billion Investor Is Sticking to Shale,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-07/dogged-4-billion-investor-roused-by-shale-s-new-zeal-for-thrift,"December 7, 2017, 4:00 PM EST",technology,"""Shale producers have potential for bigger growth: Reynolds"", ""Van Eck fund's top picks include Parsley, Newfield, Concho""","Shawn Reynolds is sticking to shale, with the $4 billion fund manager unshaken in his resolve that the U.S. industry's stocks are due for a rebound after a lackluster 2017.The veteran energy investor, whose main $2 billion fund holds about half its assets in energy and oil-services stocks, says American shale producers are now due to reap profits after years of overspending. The companies have more potential to grow compared with conventional explorers as they face fewer risks related to the extraction of resources, the fund manager at Van Eck Associates Corp. said.???There's justification for a re-rating,?? said New York-based Reynolds during an interview in Singapore last week. ??I know this shale model deserves a higher valuation than the older conventional?exploration model.??Reynolds's faith in shale companies is being reflected in the firms' plans. While crude is trading near a two-year high after last week's agreement by OPEC and its allies to extend output curbs, executives from three of the biggest independent U.S. drillers said they won't increase activity just because of higher prices. In years past, they routinely outspent their cash flow by 20 to 30 percent in an attempt to grow production as fast as possible.The emphasis now will be on maintaining spending discipline and generating profits to return to investors, according to Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Parsley Energy Inc. and Newfield Exploration Co. That helps pare concern that drillers will boost production and repeat the biggest oil crash in a generation, which began in 2014 as an American shale boom spawned a race for market share between global producers.Shale explorers and producers are going to be the biggest beneficiaries of the industry's transition to higher returns while being more disciplined, which is why the fund plans to maintain a large exposure to the group, according to Reynolds. Drilling companies and oil-service providers will also benefit, he said.??With shale, you have incredible visibility on growth, possibly the best visibility of any industry in the entire market, and lower risk,?? said Reynolds,?whose previous roles included stints at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. ??The geological risk of shale is virtually basically null.??The geological risk refers to the process by which oil and gas is extracted, and the likelihood of reaching the hydrocarbons. In fracking of shale fields, producers can make relatively accurate predictions of where resources are trapped underground before drilling vertically and horizontally through fuel-bearing rocks with the help of high-pressured water.?The turnaround period is estimated at about 12-18 months.That's in contrast to?older and conventional models of exploration that take at least five years, with companies having to borrow millions of dollars to study land formations and drill a well, hoping to hit oil and gas.Goldman Sachs echos Reynolds's view that U.S. shale drillers may be ripe for the picking, though for differing reasons. Many companies could be takeover targets as energy stocks have lagged about 40 percent behind crude oil futures this year, enabling buyers to get cash returns of as much 4 percent in 2020 even if they pay a 30 percent premium, the bank said.Reynolds is holding firm in his belief of a shale share revival despite his main fund, Van Eck Global Hard Assets Fund, losing 11 percent this year through Thursday. Five of its 10 biggest holdings posted a loss during the period, ranging from 1.4 percent to 27 percent, while gains range from 22 percent for Glencore Plc, to 4.2 percent for Concho Resources Inc.His top shale picks -- Parsley Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources and Newfield Exploration as well as Concho Resources, Cimarex Energy Co. and RSP Permian Inc. -- are down as much as 29 percent this year through Thursday, with just Concho posting an increase. For this quarter, Pioneer, Concho and RSP have gained, while oil has added 10.5 percent in New York.??There's a real ability to pick the winners versus the losers in this environment,?? Reynolds said. ??You can look at who has the best technology, who has the best sweet spot, and who's focusing on returns, not just growth.???? With assistance by Dan Murtaugh, and James Mayger"

The report was published Wednesday as a special supplement to the group's annual bulletin, and included contributions from researchers at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Climate change, driven by carbon emissions from human activity since the start of the Industrial Revolution, affected, among other things, the severity of El Nino, coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef and the warmth of the North Pacific Ocean.

The country's hunger?for renewables is so strong that almost half of the world's panels are now destined for use there next year.China's appetite is both a blessing for solar and a curse. Solar developers could find it harder to line up supplies to build plants in other countries.

Since your stovetop does not have, say, a 400F?setting, you must instead rely on primitive, vague instructions such as turning?the dial?to a spot one you hope is?halfway from medium to high. Cranking the most powerful burner to that point on your beautiful ivory Aga Legacy, at 15,000 BTUs,?will get you a good sizzle, but?going that far on a $15,000 Blue Star range that pumps out an infernal 25,000 BTUs per burner will give you a smoke-alarm-ripping sear.Knowing and controlling the temperature of your stovetop the way you know and control that?of your oven is one of the most obvious,?useful improvements one can make in the kitchen. At least, that's?the promise of the $499 Hestan Cue system, an app-controlled induction burner the size of a Roomba, with temperature-sensing pots and pans, included the newest addition, a chef's pot, all connected to each other via Bluetooth.Hestan is a part of the Meyer Corp., a Hong Kong-based manufacturer of kitchen equipment?and parent ?of such brands as?Farberware, Analon, and Silver Stone. The included 11-inch?pan is solidly constructed and hefty, at?a touch over three pounds.?The 1600-watt induction burner takes up no more space than absolutely necessary, though the fan is a bit noisy.Setup is about as?complicated as?hooking up a wireless speaker to your phone. The pan's Bluetooth transmitter is a pinky sized module that takes an (included)?AAA battery and screws into the handle. The app walks you through pairing the phone with the pan and burner. While the process is seamless, it is also much more in the spirit of Steve Jobs than Escoffier. Unlike the recent fad for ??smart?? refrigerators, dishwashers, and juicers, the Hestan Cue?is one of the few kitchen appliances that actually benefits from being connected to the internet, to the extent that you're using it for the app's recipes.The app at the center of system is, after all,?more than just a thermostat controller. It is a voluminous recipe bank with video demonstrations of crucial or confusing steps,?and it automatically controls?the burner. Most interesting is a mix-and-match option, in which you pair a protein (choices include skirt steak and salmon, sea scallops, and eggplant,?though that's not technically a protein) with a complementary sauce such as Thai green curry, bacon emulsion, and brandy-peach gastrique, to name a few. The app generates instructions on the fly.Most recipes, whether for a citrus caramel sauce or a pan-seared flat?iron steak,?start with a short video introduction that gives a sense of what you'll be shooting for. The ones I tested were all clearly written and demonstrated. For a crispy skin-duck dish, the automatic temperature control made?all the difference on?the burnt honey glaze, when the line between perfect and pan-ruiningly carbonized can be just a few seconds (or degrees).?Because the system reads the temperature of the pan and not what's in it, ingredients need to conform pretty closely to the recipes' specifications. For example, that duck recipe calls for two (or four, depending on the number of servings you select) seven-ounce?duck breasts. In the course of the preparation, you are asked to select how you would like your duck cooked??medium rare, medium, or medium well.?Then?you are asked to measure and select the thickness of your raw duck breast, using a (included) steel ruler. Those two factors will determine the precise cooking time and temperatures for the duck. In my case, it was about 13 minutes, total. If, however, you have two different-sized duck breasts, they fall outside the automated thickness range, or you want one cooked to medium and the other medium rare, the system is ill-equipped to accommodate.?Should you lose the internet connection between your pan and the app in the middle of cooking (as happened to me,) reestablishing a connection and resuming your cooking in flagrante requires a certain unflappability. That said, if you're a tech-savvy novice cook happy to stay within the app-given guardrails, you'll turn out impressive dishes and probably become a better cook in the process. If you're already an expert cook and want a commercial-grade induction burner designed with precision temperature control??both for the pan and the food you're cooking??consider the standard-setting $1,799?Control Freak from Breville and Polyscience.?Both the Control Freak and the Hestan Cue have a distinct drawback: cleanup. Since either is likely to be on your countertop, not on your more easily cleaned stovetop surface??or for that matter, under your vent hood??smell and splatter will be less contained. Should that be an overriding concern, General Electric Co.?offers an interesting product in its $144 Precision Cooking Probe, compatible with Monogram and Cafe series induction cooktops. It fixes magnetically to any induction-compatible pot or pan and provides similar temperature-control functionality.While we're undeniably heading toward?more precise temperature control in the kitchen, the timetable is as murky as ever. Gas ranges remain incredibly popular, and the habits gained from millennia of cooking over open flames are not likely to ease their grip anytime soon. But induction-cooking technology, which has been around since the beginning of the 20th century,?is?making inroads into home kitchens. Hestan?is?smart to bank?on the idea that if you learn to cook using induction heat, it'll set your appetite for a more precise way to cook on high."

Hours earlier a Korean crypto exchange went bust after getting hacked; U.S. regulators halted a coin trader's stock on suspicion of manipulation;?a stock unheard of two days ago surged even after its CEO gave a rambling defense of its business; alt coins ether and iota reached new record highs; and an app maker's shares jumped about eightfold intraday after getting a bitcoin ATM patent.The frenzy is reminiscent of the heady days of the dot-com bubble, when stories of mailroom millionaires sparked a rush to list anything remotely related to the internet. That's not to say the digital currency craze must end any time soon. Tuesday even brought a sign that it's just getting started: A unit of Cboe Global Markets filed to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Here's a roundup of the last two days in crypto:Charlie Lee, creator of the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency by value, said he no longer owns any Litecoin, other than a few physical collectibles. ??In the past days, I have sold and donated all my LTC. Litecoin has been very good for me financially, so I am well off enough that I no longer need to tie my financial success to Litecoin's success,?? he said in a Reddit post.Coinbase Inc., one of the most popular U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding bitcoin cash to its offerings, giving momentum to a rival of the most popular digital unit. There was a hitch, however. The San Francisco-based company said it's investigating a price increase in bitcoin cash that occurred before the announcement. Bitcoin itself fell about 10 percent after the news. While Coinbase briefly enabled orders to be posted in U.S. dollars on its platform for more sophisticated traders, it suspended it after two minutes due to ??significant volatility,?? the company said in a blog post. Coinbase plans to reopen the order books Wednesday.And speaking of suspensions, U.S. regulators temporarily halted trading in Crypto Co. over concerns that the stock is being manipulated after it surged more than 2,700 percent this month, making paper billionaires out of top executives. Crypto is the product of a reverse merger with a company that made water and radio-wave resistant sports bra pockets, according to a November filing. Last week it issued stock to accredited investors at $7, a 97 percent discount to the prior day's closing price.Just when there looked to be a limit to the mania, LongFin Corp. captured the attention of the masses.

The interview did not go well for him as he got into a heated debate with the anchors, telling them, ??you don't understand.?? Overnight LongFin shares stumbled...but they resumed their ascent in regular trading, rising as much as 23 percent before ending the day little changed.South Korean coin exchange Youbit became a casualty of hackers, saying it will close and enter bankruptcy after a cyberattack. Korea has emerged as a sort of ground zero for the global crypto mania, with so many Koreans embracing bitcoin that the prime minister recently warned that cryptocurrencies might corrupt the nation's youth.Riot Blockchain Inc., a stock virtually unknown three months ago, had a secondary offering as its shares pushed their gain since September to 700 percent.

He said Wednesday that the spate of executive departures Tesla has endured this year is reminiscent of Enron before its fall. Chanos also said his short against Tesla has lost him money to this point and he doesn't know when its stock actually will decline.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Chanos predicted Musk will depart Tesla in the coming years for another one of his companies, Space Exploration Technologies Corp.?Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said earlier this month he could envision Tesla merging with SpaceX as the rocket company becomes a more time-consuming focus for Musk.Tesla has been successful because it was the first company to make electric cars fun and attractive, Chanos said.

That fanned investor concerns about debt elsewhere in the company's businesses in the South Pacific nation. Dollar bonds from wholly owned unit Adani Abbot Point Terminal Pty -- which oversees a deep water port on the coast of Queensland -- sunk to fresh lows after the news.While Adani's port business is financed separately from its mining division, the company intends to transport coal sourced from its planned Carmichael mine by rail to the export terminal at the port.Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., and China Construction Bank Corp. all said this week they won't loan money to develop the Carmichael mine. They join a burgeoning list of lenders including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Australia's four major banks in ruling out providing loans for the project, which has faced opposition from environmentalists who say it will increase carbon pollution and endanger the health of the state's Great Barrier Reef.Adani Abbot Point's notes due 2022 have dropped to 97.5 cents on the dollar since issuance at about 99.4 cents last week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Adani plans to build a 388-kilometer (241-mile) rail line to link the mine to the port, which it acquired for A$1.8 billion in 2011.

The oxygen-to-grain ratio has been precisely?calibrated?with the aid of X-ray tests.?A razor slices the sheet into a flawless rectangle, which plunks down onto?a steel tray?ready to be stuffed with ruby-red tuna or?smoked eel.The $14,000?robot?can?help a food prep worker churn out 200 sushi rolls an hour??up from the 50 or so a chef could make by hand, according to Autec?USA Inc., the Torrance, Calif., company that sells the machine. Chief Executive Officer Taka Tanaka says orders have quadrupled over five years amid rising sushi consumption and a growing chef shortage. Among his customers are Whole Foods Market and Sushirrito, a mini-chain of restaurants that specializes in a burrito-sushi amalgam.Service industries have lagged other sectors in spending on labor-saving equipment during this economic expansion, because as long as workers were plentiful and wages stagnant, it made more sense to hire than to invest in automation. As U.S. labor markets tighten, the calculus is changing. ??You're?investing in capital because you grudgingly have to pay workers more,?? says Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economist at Bloomberg.Analysts at Morgan Stanley expect a pickup in capital investment in services, which span luxury retail to internet services, to carry over into next year. That bodes well for worker productivity, which has been depressed for a decade but began showing signs of life sometime around midyear. If the improvement is sustained, it could boost the growth potential of the U.S. economy, lead to raises for workers, and even allow the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates more.?Stronger productivity is ??the salve for everything,?? says Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. ??It's something that has been sorely needed in the U.S., and it is finally here.??Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists wrote in a November note to clients that capital outlays across all sectors have been the ??brightest spot?? in gross domestic product data?and that they expect spending to continue to ??modestly outperform???compared with its usual rate this late in an expansion. Their optimism is partly grounded on the expectation that?the corporate tax reduction and other investment incentives contained in the tax plan that could soon pass Congress will provide a further moderate boost.Services look poised to remain the star performer. They make up a growing share of the economy??64 percent of gross output last year, up from 40 percent in the 1950s??but their share of capital expenditures has been relatively flat over time. A Morgan Stanley analysis of 1,500 publicly traded companies found that many businesses are going beyond replacing old equipment. They're also pouring money into new technology, along with buildings and production equipment. U.S.?Department of Commerce data show that for the first time since 2000, investment in intellectual-property products (think software, as well as research and development) has surpassed 4 percent of GDP.Surveys of corporate managers suggest capital outlays could remain robust into 2018. The Morgan Stanley six-month capital expenditure plan index?is holding at levels last seen in 2006.Nevertheless, productivity gains are happening in the context of diminished expectations. Efficiency?has increased by an average 1.5 percent this year, and Morgan Stanley expects it to settle into a pattern of just above?1 percent in the future. That's far below the 2.7 percent it averaged from 2000 to the eve of the Great Recession.To nudge the dial toward historical norms, the capital spending pickup would have to mirror the scale of investment U.S. companies were making in the 1990s, according to J.P. Morgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli, who thinks that's?unlikely.?What's more, Feroli sees demographic changes weighing on productivity as a large generation of experienced older workers exits the workforce. ??You have the baby boomers leaving, and they're generally pretty skilled at this point,?? he says. As of 2016?about 6.8 percent of the country's population was 50 to 59 years old and headed toward retirement soon.On the bright side, even a small pickup is good news for the Fed. If the economy has more productive capacity, interest rates can rise higher and the economy can expand faster without coming up against supply constraints that cause inflation to spike. That'd be a relief for policymakers, who are already concerned about how they'll fight the next recession in a world where interest rates are at historical lows.Efficiency improvement could also allow companies to pay workers more without taking a hit to profits. ??Productivity growth has really been dismally slow in recent years,?? Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers during testimony on Nov. 29. ??I think to really see a faster average pace of real wage growth, we need faster productivity.??Any uptick could be global. Citigroup Inc. reckons 2017 is shaping up to be the first year since 1995 in which the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and the euro area all witnessed accelerating productivity.Tanaka expects demand for his robots to stay strong. His most popular machines are an example of the kind of automation that can make life easier for workers??rolling out rice over sheets of nori is one of the most difficult, and tedious, parts of sushi making??rather than make them obsolete. Customization??inserting different kinds of filling??still requires humans. ??It's half-automated,?? Tanaka says. ??People can still be entertained by watching the chef.?????With Matthew Boesler"

Banker Pay Will Probably Fall When Robots Take Over: Nordea,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/banker-pay-will-probably-fall-when-robots-take-over-nordea-says,"December 5, 2017, 10:00 PM EST",business,"""Nordea CEO says we'll need to monitor what value humans add"", ""Biggest Nordic bank is cutting 6,000 jobs to go digital""","The chief executive officer of Nordea Bank AB says his industry needs to rethink pretty much everything it's doing to brace for the future. And that includes how much it's paying bankers.The Nordic region's biggest financial conglomerate is already in the process of cutting 6,000 jobs as part of a shift toward relying more on technology and less on humans. But CEO Casper von Koskull says the search for more efficient ways of doing business won't end once those jobs are gone.??People said automation is only in personal banking,?? von Koskull said in an interview in Stockholm. ??But there are elements of it in investment banking, corporate banking, liquidity management, foreign exchange. You need to look at how much of it is automated and whether there's less human involvement.??There will always be a ??human element,?? he says. But ultimately, ??you need to ask the question, what value is the human adding, and how does that affect pay???Fintech Frenzy Threatens Traditional Bank Model With Policy PushVon Koskull's mission is to blaze a trail that other banks will be inspired to follow. In explaining his world view, he uses phrases like ??you don't need banks, but you need banking.?? He also insists that ??bankers need to be more tech savvy, and understand how you use tools.??The Nordea CEO envisions a flatter organization. So when it comes to the bank's planned job cuts, that means ??the ones who are mostly hit are middle to higher-level management, because those layers aren't needed, or shouldn't be,?? von Koskull said.None of this should make a career as a banker less appealing, according to von Koskull.??If you're passionate about the customer and about providing value to customers, and frankly also to society, I think it's a fantastic place, still, to work,?? he said.Investment banking, in particular, is a special case, according to the Nordea CEO. ??Because at the end of the day, it's not just about the facts,?? he said. ??I've always said finance is a social science anyway, it's not an exact science. So if you're a merger adviser or a wealth adviser, it's about trust and relevance.?? But even here, ??technology will have an impact.??And banks are ??also a place where a lot of society would say that we are still, even, paid too much,?? von Koskull said.The question of banker pay is one that regularly triggers acrimony from some corners of society. Just last month, the CEO of UBS Group AG, Sergio Ermotti, and a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Paul Tucker, were at opposite ends of a heated debate questioning the remuneration culture in the finance industry. At the same time, there's a growing list of banks who are ditching humans as they rely more on automation.UBS CEO Has Heated Exchange With Ex-Senior Central BankerVon Koskull says that banks who don't follow Nordea's lead are ignoring ??cost drift.?? He expects his firm to soon be ??probably the only large European bank that has completely transformed its core bank system to a modern system.

Uber will retain the remaining 49 percent.Under the agreement, ComfortDelGro taxi drivers will be able to receive ride requests on the Uber driver app, while allowing users of Uber's app to directly book ComfortDelGro taxis. The move follows a year in which Grab, which competes head-to-head with Uber across seven countries in Southeast Asia, expanded its market share in private-vehicle rides to 72 percent.Uber drivers in Singapore typically rent their cars from the company because vehicle costs in the country are among the world's most expensive. The 51 percent that ComfortDelGro is buying is valued at about S$642 million, including cash and loans, according to the taxi company.ComfortDelGro said in August it signed a letter for exclusive discussions with Uber for a potential alliance. Its shares have lost about 11 percent of their value since then as investors lost patience with the plan. They closed Friday at S$1.91, down 1.6 percent.Grab President Ming Maa this week said Uber is ??under siege?? from multiple rivals in multiple geographies for the first time this year. Uber agreed in July to merge its operations in Russia and neighboring ex-Soviet republics into a joint venture, the second retreat from a major market by the San Francisco-based company. Last year it ceded China to rival Didi Chuxing in exchange for a minority stake."

Its network of vendors has climbed to about 38,000 as of November from 20,000 in February, closing in on a target of doubling within a year, Oka said in an interview.A rickshaw driver waits for customers during a campaign event for Alipay in Tokyo.An affiliate of billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Ant Financial entered Japan in 2015?to cater to Chinese visitors who are increasingly shopping with their mobile phones instead of cash.

According to Goldman Sachs, the new sector may become the fourth-biggest among 11 S&P 500 groups.With companies including Google parent Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc., Comcast Corp. and Walt Disney Co. poised to join communications, ETFs focusing on consumer discretionary and tech industries may be forced to sell about one-fifth of their holdings to mimic the changes. Some funds such as SPDR S&P Internet ETF may have to overhaul their methodology because the sub-index it tracks will no longer exist, according to Lin.His view is based on an assumption that ETF providers have no special transition plans to mitigate expected turnover. When a similar reclassification landed on bank and real estate stocks, ETF firms used a hodgepodge of strategies to maintain continuity for their customers, including special dividends that worked like spinoffs.??The changes this?time around are more intricate so it is unlikely to be as clean a transition,?but it is a possibility to keep in mind,?? Lin wrote in a note. ??Given the sizable difference in asset sizes between existing telecom ETFs and technology/consumer discretionary ETFs, the companies moving to the new communications sector are large net sells.??Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. may turn out to be the biggest beneficiaries because of the reinvestment trades, where the cash received from selling the migrating stocks are added to existing members in tech and consumer sectors, Lin said."

The battle to contain the rebels forced Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to dissolve the local legislature and schedule snap elections for Thursday.One senior Spanish official said the government may have been slow to respond to modern Russian psyop capabilities but it now has the tools needed to defend the country's ??information space?? during the Catalan vote and beyond. The official declined to elaborate, citing national security concerns.Rajoy's critics say he and his ministers have been harping on the issue since the referendum to distract the public from their attempt to stop millions of Catalonians with long-held grievances from expressing their will at the ballot box. The level of rancor generated by the movement has broken the pact that's kept regional tensions in check since the 1970s and prompted European leaders to mount an awkward defense of their Spanish ally's clampdown.""Spain was a secondary target,?? said Ben Nimmo,?who tracks Russian disinformation campaigns at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab in Washington. ??The primary target is the validity of Western democracy.??Western officials have expressed concern that sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine and alleged meddling in the U.S. election last year have done little to curb the Kremlin's appetite for political offensives that involve everything from overt news outlets to covert hacking networks.Russia's strategy for stoking unrest in Catalonia and elsewhere has been based on using trolls and bots to spread ever-more subtle forms of propaganda through fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms, they say.Britain's top national security adviser, Mark Sedwill, urged lawmakers this week to read ??The Art of War?? by Sun Tzu for advice on dealing with Russia in the digital age. One nugget from the ancient Chinese general: ??The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.??A study by George Washington University found that?stories about Catalonia that were produced by Russian cable channel RT and news service Sputnik were shared 10 times more than those of their Spanish counterparts,?RTVE and EFE. Both RT and Sputnik broadcast and write in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, German and Arabic.A state-funded think tank in Madrid found that legions of Russian hackers and trolls set up thousands of automated bots and fake accounts to promote stories that portrayed the central government in as bad a light as possible.Here are just two examples of Catalan stories produced by the Kremlin's media arm that were widely circulated and wildly misleading:??Spanish Gov't Finds No Data on Alleged Russian Meddling in Catalonia's Affairs?? was published in English by Sputnik on Nov. 11.Then there was this Oct. 28 story by RT's Spanish-language service, which went viral: ??Tanks in the streets of Barcelona??: Spain and Catalonia on the verge of a violent outcome.??But the most influential posts in the run-up to the Catalan referendum appear to have come from two real people, both of whom are U.S. adversaries with unusual ties to the Kremlin: Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.Original posts by the WikiLeaks founder and NSA whistleblower accounted for almost a third of the 150,000 tweets and retweets using the #Catalonia hashtag in the 10 days to Sept. 24, according to the Hashtagify monitoring tool.The right of self-determination??for people to freely decide their own system of government??cannot simply be outlawed. It is a human right. https://t.co/vXcMw2qnCESputnik headlined 11 Catalan stories with Assange comments, including one that accused Bloomberg of propaganda.??They effectively weaponized his tweets,?? said the Atlantic Council's Nimmo.It was a well-timed operation, with pro-Kremlin Twitter accounts increasing their mentions of the crisis by 2,000 percent in the 48 hours leading up to the referendum, El Pais newspaper reported, citing real-time data compiled by the U.S.-based Alliance for Securing Democracy.Russia, though, continues to ridicule Spanish assertions of interference.??Any volcano, meteorite or earthquake is all Moscow's work because like some divine force it manages to be everywhere,?? said Andrei Klimov, deputy head of the international affairs committee of the upper house of parliament.President Vladimir Putin has been more circumspect, branding the West hypocritical for backing the independence of Kosovo from Russia's ally Serbia while denying the same right to Catalonia. (Spain is among a handful of EU members that don't recognize Kosovo.)Suspicions in Madrid grew after South Ossetia, a tiny Kremlin protectorate that Russia went to war against Georgia over in 2008, opened a representative office in Barcelona in October.??We're monitoring the situation,?? South Ossetia's deputy foreign minister, Alan Kochiev, said by phone. ??For us, the most important thing is that everything be decided in a democratic manner, without any pressure.??The South Ossetian mission is just the latest example of Russia's increasingly open support of strategically selected independence movements.Back in 2012, Catalonia's then-leader Artur Mas led a delegation to drum up backing in Moscow, where met with one of Putin's closest allies, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who was the governor of the Moscow region at the time. Catalan separatists returned in 2015 and 2016 for an annual congress of rebel parties organized by?the Kremlin-funded Anti-Globalization Movement.??The Catalans understood that if a referendum was successful they would need legitimacy -- and legitimization is recognition at a government level,?? the head of the movement, Alexander Ionov, said in an interview in Moscow.Ionov has a history of working with some of Russia's most politically sensitive allies. In 2014, before Putin joined the war in Syria, he met Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. He said he's killed extremists in Syria while fighting alongside Hezbollah brigades and represented Ukrainian rebels in South America.With Catalonia's separatist parties in danger of losing their majority in the regional parliament on Thursday, Ionov said they may have to ??go underground?? for a bit, but that doesn't mean they won't prevail.??Every nation has a right to self-determination and they should follow this path to the end if there's no other choice,?? he said.Now that Catalan independence is no longer at the boiling point, Russia's strategy is to back off and see what happens, according to Sergei Markov, a political consultant to Putin's staff.??Although we do have sympathy for all separatists, we've put it to one side at the request of the Spanish government,?? Markov said. ??But of course, the more problems the European Union has the better. We have to counter this aggressive anti-Russian trend.???? With assistance by Ilya Arkhipov"

Stagecoach Says Grayling Hasn't Let It Off Hook With Rail Reboot,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/stagecoach-says-grayling-hasn-t-let-it-off-hook-with-rail-reboot,"December 6, 2017, 12:02 PM EST",technology,"""Cost hit from U.K.'s East Coast route is unchanged, CEO says"", ""Government rethink still saves 2 billion pounds in repayments""","U.K. train operator?Stagecoach Group Plc said it welcomes the government's early termination of its unprofitable East Coast franchise but that the move is part of a wider realignment of rail policy and not designed to let it avoid future charges.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling last week revealed that the franchise, due to run until 2023, will be terminated in 2020 and replaced with a partnership of track and train operators. Stagecoach Chief Executive Officer Martin Griffiths said the company will still book costs and impairment charges of almost 130 million pounds ($174 million) against the route.??We support the direction of travel set out by Chris Grayling,?? Griffiths said in an interview Wednesday, adding that it's in discussions with the government about recasting the truncated contract, with an agreement likely in the next few months. The terms should deliver value for taxpayers, while ensuring?revenue risk remaining with Stagecoach is ??acceptable,?? he said. Britain's opposition Labour Party says Grayling has let Stagecoach and partner Virgin Trains off the hook for the bulk of future East Coast costs as part of his wider overhaul of the U.K. railway. The companies originally agreed to pay 3.3 billion pounds to run the route, weighted toward the last years of the contract, as is standard, so that early termination could save them 2 billion pounds.??There is no change to either the estimate of the onerous contract provision reported in June or the extent of the maximum financial commitments of the parent company in respect of the current franchise contract,?? Stagecoach said.Following the announcement of the charges in June, some 105 million pounds out of a loan commitment of 165 million pounds had been drawn down as of Oct. 28, almost double the amount in April, it said, adding that the total amount will be funded in full.Griffiths said he didn't rule out re-bidding for the new East Coast franchise from 2020, assuming the commercial terms are attractive. Stagecoach already has experience of working in tandem with state-backed track operator Network Rail Ltd. on its former South West Trains franchise, though that deal was terminated and the East Coast crunch has also involved infrastructure issues.Shares of Stagecoach rose 6 percent before closing 0.9 percent higher in London after the company posted better-than-expected earnings for the fiscal first half ended Oct. 28 and reiterated the full-year outlook.The stock gained 13 percent on Nov. 29, when Grayling announced the East Coast changes, having dropped 6.2 percent June 28 when the company disclosed the one-time charges."

Meet the Silver Lake Partner Who Helped Engineer the Qualcomm Bid,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/meet-the-silver-lake-partner-who-helped-engineer-qualcomm-bid,"December 15, 2017, 1:34 PM EST",technology,"""Ken Hao made the original approach to Qualcomm executives"", ""His partnership with Broadcom's Hock Tan transformed industry""","Hock Tan is the man most associated with Broadcom Ltd.'s $105 billion offer for Qualcomm Inc., but he couldn't have mounted the audacious bid without Silver Lake managing partner?Ken Hao. It was Hao who recruited Tan and helped him become one of the firm's most favored executives. And it was Hao who originally approached Qualcomm.Over the past dozen or so years, the two men have helped Silver Lake generate huge returns and turn the Silicon Valley PE firm into a leading actor in the rapidly consolidating chip industry. Now the duo's partnership is being tested as never before. Qualcomm's flat-out rejection of the deal has forced the bidders to go hostile. That's unfamiliar territory for PE firms, which generally abandoned unfriendly takeovers about two decades ago when competition to win over management teams started steadily heating up.??It is unusual,?? said Steve Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ??The activists have tended to be the hostile folks and the private equity investors have tended to be on the friendly side because it's hard to get a deal done if you are hostile these days.??Hao is one of five Silver Lake managing partners -- the firm has no chief executive -- empowered to cook up their own deals. Hao plucked Tan from relative obscurity back in 2006 to run an ailing chip company spun off from Hewlett-Packard. Hao shared Tan's conviction that the chip business had matured and needed to abandon a costly obsession with expanding into new areas. Over the next few years, Tan proved the case by focusing on Avago's core strengths and turning the former HP division around.In 2013, the two men met at Tai Pan restaurant in Palo Alto, California, about four miles from Silver Lake's headquarters on Sand Hill Road. The restaurant, a Hong Kong-style dim sum place with white linen tablecloths, is a favorite of Tan's. In Cantonese slang its name means someone who has made it big.Over their meal, Hao made a pitch. While Avago was still relatively small, accounting for less than 1 percent of overall chip industry sales, Hao said it was time for Avago to start rolling up chip companies. The industry was fragmented and rife with small players, often founder run, struggling to grow as their costs rose, prices stagnated and their customers got bigger.?Hao's pitch foretold the consolidation to come.??We conceived the second chapter,?? he recalled in an interview.The men focused on whether they could pull off a takeover of LSI Corp.,?a maker of chips that control computer storage devices.?In 2014, Avago acquired the company for $6.6 billion, with Silver Lake cementing the deal with $1 billion of convertible debt.?Overnight it doubled Avago's revenue and set the stage for that company's deal with Broadcom, consummated in 2016 for a then record industry price of $37 billion. (Silver Lake didn't participate in that deal.)Time and again, Hao has acted as Tan's emissary to potential targets.?He brought in the then CEO of LSI for the first approach and also helped win over Broadcom's founders, key to winning support of a huge block of its shareholders. In the spring of 2016, he had the first meeting with Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf, in an initial attempt to get a conversation rolling.This time, talks fizzled out, prompting Broadcom to make an open $70-a-share proposal that was quickly rebuffed. The suitors have since nominated directors to Qualcomm's board in an attempt to appeal directly to shareholders.That has put Tan and Silver Lake in uncharted territory. It's the first time the private equity firm has backed a hostile takeover. In a testament to the managing partners' commitment, the firm is set to invest as much as $2.5 billion in the deal, its biggest equity check yet, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Getting the deal done will require Tan and Hao to persuade Qualcomm shareholders that the chipmaker needs a new strategy. Tan believes the company should focus on the core mobile chip business; Qualcomm is busily diversifying into other businesses, including servers and personal computers.Having watched Tan turn Broadcom into a powerhouse, Hao says his partner is best suited to lead Qualcomm's next chapter. ??No one,?? he says, ??has executed on consolidation in the semiconductor industry with the success and scale and rapidity of integration as Hock Tan.??If past is prologue, Silver Lake has sufficient appetite for risk to try to bring Qualcomm to heel. In 2013, the firm ponied up $1.4 billion to help Michael Dell take his eponymous company private; two years later Silver Lake invested an additional $1 billion for Dell Inc. to acquire EMC Corp., the biggest-ever tech deal at the time."

In addition, the firm plans to inject as much as A$3 billion in equity funding for the project, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details are private.Lenders?from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to three of China's largest banks have excluded themselves from the project, prompting researcher BIS Oxford Economics to say Adani's plans fail to stack up?financially.?The project has drawn ire from environmentalists who say it will endanger the health of the nation's Great Barrier Reef, and Australia's four largest banks have also distanced themselves.Even a scaled-down version of Adani&apos;s Carmichael mine would be one of the world&apos;s biggest coal pitsSource: Company websites and reportsNote: mtpa = million metric tons per annum. The list isn&apos;t intended to be comprehensive.""We would not be investing our time, money and energy in this manner if our projects were not viable and if we were not serious about delivering our projects,"" Adani Australia's Brisbane-based spokesman said in an emailed response to questions Friday. The company has invested A$3.3 billion across its existing projects in Queensland, according to the email. Adani didn't respond to questions concerning the details on its funding plans for the project.Local authorities in Queensland have said they would block a loan of A$900 million that Adani had sought from Australia's government to build the 388 kilometer rail line connecting Carmichael to the company's Abbot Point port near the Great Barrier Reef. Adani plans to start shipping the fossil fuel from 2020 directly from the port to India for use in coal-fired power stations.Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., and China Construction Bank Corp., all said earlier this month that they won't loan money for the project.Still, Adani remains focused on courting Chinese lenders to help finance the development, according to the person.The company aims to produce 27.5 million tons of coal a year in the first phase of production, the person said. It had previously outlined an eventual annual target of 60 million tons from the mine, according to a Queensland government document.?? With assistance by Matthew Burgess"
Apple Gives $390 Million to Finisar for FaceID iPhone Component,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/apple-gives-390-million-to-finisar-for-faceid-iphone-component,"December 13, 2017, 8:57 AM EST",technology,"""Money coming from $1 billion manufacturing fund to create jobs"", ""Funds to be used to reopen Texas plant and employ 500 people""","Apple Inc. is spending $390 million to boost production from a maker of laser technology that's critical for new iPhone X features such as facial recognition.Apple,?whose products can stretch the manufacturing capabilities of suppliers, will invest the money in Finisar Corp. from a $1 billion manufacturing fund announced earlier this year with the aim of creating more American jobs. Finisar will use the funds to reopen a plant in Sherman, Texas, that will employ 500 people. Finisar's shares surged as much as 32 percent, the biggest intraday gain since 2009. Apple stock rose less than 1 percent.The design process at Apple balances creating ground-breaking technology against the manufacturing challenge of finding suppliers who can provide the number of components needed to put new features inside hundreds of millions of handsets.?Many of Apple's new facial-recognition features -- including one in which emojis mimic a person's facial expressions -- require lasers that track tiny movements. The technology, which uses vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, is also part of the company's emerging augmented reality efforts. Apple said it will purchase 10 times more of the technology this quarter than has ever previously been manufactured over a three-month period.Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst who now serves as a partner at Loup Ventures, said the deal gives Apple a competitive advantage for smartphone-based augmented reality products.?""This investment shows the company is doubling down on AR again, and locks down the VCSEL market, which will make it tough for other smartphone players to compete in AR,"" he wrote. The deal also suggests Apple will include these sensors in additional products. The iPhone X is currently the only Apple product with a facial recognition sensor. Apple is working on a new iPad with the feature for next year, Bloomberg News has reported.The deal with Finisar demonstrates Apple's ability to play king-maker among component suppliers. Finisar share gains on Wednesday helped pare its losses for the year, which stood at 36 percent through Tuesday's close. A competing maker of 3-D sensors, Lumentum Holdings Inc., fell as much as 15 percent, its biggest intraday drop in more than two years.""While this investment will likely come across as bad for Lumentum, we do not believe Lumentum's relationship with the company has necessarily been affected,"" Munster said. ""Given the limited supply of VCSEL arrays worldwide, as well as the limited manufacturing capacity of Finisar and Lumentum, we believe Apple will need multiple suppliers in order to meet their demand targets.""Founded in 1988 and with 14,000 employees, Finisar has primarily made components used in networking and the internet, including voice and video communications, storage and television. Its other customers include Cisco Systems Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Huawei Technologies Co.With much of the manufacturing and assembly for its products done in China, Apple has faced criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and others for not creating more jobs in the U.S. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook announced the manufacturing fund in May. Corning Inc., the maker of glass for iPhone and iPad screens, earlier received $200 million for glass processing.?? With assistance by Mark Gurman"
The Retail Apocalypse Is Fueled by No-Name Clothes,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/the-retail-apocalypse-is-fueled-by-no-name-clothes,"December 11, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",,"""Private-label attire in aggregate is now a bigger seller in the U.S. than any single apparel brand.""","A few months ago, Amazon.com Inc. representatives met with fashion designer Jackie Wilson as part of the expansion of Amazon's surging apparel business. They wanted her to make a knit top for women that would be sold under an Amazon-owned private label. And they wanted the fabric to feel heavy and high-quality??the sort of attributes?long associated in the shopping mind with name-brand attire.??They are not concerned at all about how many units they sell, and they're not focused on margins,?? says Wilson, whose company in Syracuse, N.Y., makes clothing for Kohl's, American Eagle Outfitters, and J.C. Penney Co. ??They're concerned about customer satisfaction. They want five-star reviews.??Wilson's knit top is in the vanguard of a private-label push that's upended the $275 billion U.S. apparel sector. Amazon, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp., and other big retailers are beefing up their clothing lines to grab shoppers whose loyalty to established brands such as Gap and Nike has waned. Even supermarket chain Kroger Co. is getting in on the act, attracted by profit margins that far exceed what they earn?on bananas and paper towels.This year Amazon will leapfrog T.J. Maxx owner TJX Cos. and Macy's Inc. to become the second-biggest seller of apparel and footwear in the U.S., Wells Fargo estimates. In some categories??like the active?wear that Americans increasingly wear all day, whether or not they hit the gym??private labels combined account for 20 percent of the market, according to researcher NPD. That makes store brands in aggregate larger than any single brand, which should strike fear in the executive suites of Lululemon?Athletica, Nike, and Under Armour.??Active?wear is going like wildfire,?? Wilson says, for the simple reason that ??you don&apos;t have to try on spandex pants. If I was in those categories, I would be worried.??Store-brand apparel is nothing new. The Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog first offered clothing in 1894, and Wal-Mart's Faded Glory house brand began life in 1972 as a department-store label. But for years, private-label apparel was dull and dowdy, no match for branded threads.That started to change in 1990 when British supermarket chain Asda?Stores asked fashion designer George Davies to create an exclusive clothing line. The result, George, was a hit in the U.K. and caught the attention of Canadian retailer Loblaws?Cos. Ltd., which in 2004 hired Joe Mimran, co-founder of the Club Monaco chain, to do the same. His?Joe Fresh?expanded into standalone stores and a partnership with J.C. Penney in the U.S. But the brand didn't click with Penney's shoppers, prompting Mimram's departure in 2015 and an overhaul of the business.Despite its recent struggles, Joe Fresh ??was a nice surprise to other retailers who said, ??Hey, if they can do this, we can, too,'?? says?Adheer Bahulkar, a partner at consultants A.T. Kearney.As retailers stepped up investments, connected with Asian suppliers, and poached fashionistas to head up in-house design teams, the established brands stumbled under the weight of declining mall traffic and heaps of unsold inventory. Brand loyalty began to crater.Under Armour has been battered by slowing growth in athletic footwear, J.Crew Group has struggled to reinvent itself after the departure of longtime Chief Executive Officer?Mickey Drexler, and Gap's only bright spot lately is its off-price Old Navy chain. Even mighty Nike this year announced its?first major layoffs since the financial crisis.??Every new generation is becoming less and less brand-loyal,?? Bahulkar says. ??Millennials don't care as much about logos. They will buy anything from anywhere at any price point, and that is a big change.??The erosion of brand loyalty has been a boon for Target, the cheap-chic retailer that made its name in apparel via partnerships with top designers Isaac Mizrahi and Jason Wu more than a decade ago. It's leveraged that success to create its own private labels in recent years, most notably Cat & Jack, a kids'?apparel line whose sales surpassed $2 billion after a little more than a year on the shelves. Target's winning formula has emboldened Wal-Mart, which recently hired a veteran of Saks Fifth Avenue and Ralph Lauren Corp. to boost its fashion game.Apparel shopping these days often begins with an online search, and research from consultants Bain & Co. finds that a surprising number of those queries don't mention a brand at all??consumers just enter ??yoga pants?? and see what comes up.Searching for generic product categories on Amazon turns up plenty of private-label options. More than one-quarter of first-page Amazon search results in categories such as?men's button-down shirts were private labels, Bain says. That helps explain why almost 40 cents of every dollar spent online on clothing and footwear in the U.S. will go to Amazon this year, according to data tracker Euromonitor, up from 23 cents in 2014.Amazon is capitalizing on this in two ways. First, despite its private-label push, it's simultaneously trying to create legitimacy as a destination for fashion by luring established brands that want to improve their digital sales, even if it means submitting to Amazon's pricing algorithms. Heads turned when Nike began selling its shoes directly on the site over the summer. And Calvin Klein recently opened two pop-up shops in New York and Los Angeles whose fitting rooms are outfitted with an Echo, an?Amazon?device?that lets?users submit photos of outfits and recommends the best one. There's also a dedicated Calvin Klein storefront on Amazon.com with exclusive items.Not every fashion brand is as willing to hop into bed with Amazon, fearing a loss of cachet. But with mall-based department stores falling out of favor, analysts at Goldman Sachs say they expect the ??vast majority?? of labels to follow that path and deepen their relationship with Jeff Bezos.Simultaneously, Amazon has introduced a bevy of private labels with names such as?Peak Velocity in categories that include shirts and sportswear, where fit and function??plus the convenience of free shipping??are?often more important than the latest fashions. One example is plus-size for women, where Amazon increased its market share about 50 percent over the past three years, Bain says.Plus-size is ??radically underserved,?? Bain partner Tamar Dor-Ner says. ??The thing that made it even more attractive for Amazon is it's a shopper who traditionally doesn't want to go into the store.??Luckily for the big brands, three-fourths of apparel shoppers still prefer to feel or try on the product before buying, A.T. Kearney says. The likes of Lululemon can counterattack with so-called curated merchandising, industry jargon for showing shoppers that this top goes well with those pants. Despite experiments such as?the Amazon Echo, the online giant is not there yet.??I don't know anyone who is jumping up and down about buying clothes on Amazon,?? says Candace Corlett, president of WSL Strategic Retail. ??They've put together a lot of midpriced, uninteresting stuff.??But private labels don't need to inspire. Like Jackie Wilson's knit top, they just need to satisfy a need.??We don't expect private labels to become fashion houses, but they can create enough newness that they can capture sales,?? A.T. Kearney's?Bahulkar says. ??Competing with Amazon is a losing proposition.???Read This Next:? America's ??Retail Apocalypse' Is Really Just Beginning"

The ??particularly large?? revenue of?Google's parent, Alphabet Inc., also determined the size of the fine, the EU said.The penalty, levied in June, was more than double an earlier 1 billion-euro fine on Intel and came with a threat of more daily fines for Google if it didn't comply with an order to offer equal treatment to rival shopping-comparison services. Big numbers for big technology names have been a theme for EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who ordered Apple Inc. to pay back some 13 billion euros in taxes last year.??It is very surprising to speak of deterrence when the behavior is novel, as in the Google case,?? said Dirk Auer, a research fellow at Liege University's Competition and Innovation Institute. ??Large fines can only have a deterrent effect if firms know that their behavior might infringe the law. Here, the behavior is not listed?? in the EU's enforcement priority and ""Google is challenging this very point"" in its court appeal.The EU defended its move to levy a fine in a case that raised some new issues, in a young industry it hasn't investigated thoroughly before now.??Even if the conduct may have certain features that have not been examined in past decisions, this does not prevent the imposition of a fine,"" it said in the document. ??Contrary to what Google claims, Google and Alphabet committed the infringement described in this decision intentionally or negligently?? and the company ??could not have been unaware of the fact that Google held a dominant position in the national markets for general search.??The fine was based on revenue from Google's comparison-shopping service in 13 European countries, including sales from the paid product results and bottom text ads displayed on the Google Shopping website. That amount was multiplied by a figure that was redacted from the EU document.??I wonder whether it was even reasonable for the commission to impose any fine at all,?? said Damien Geradin, a professor at Tilburg University's Law & Economics Centre. Regulators' explanations ??fail to convince that there is a need for an additional?? multiplier of the penalty and the size of the fine needs to reflect the gravity of the infringement ""which could not be that bad since the commission was willing to settle the case"" at an earlier stage of its probe.Google said that while it?disagrees with the decision and has appealed it, it has also ""implemented a remedy, as ordered by the EC, to ensure equal treatment for competitors,"" it said in a statement.??We have cooperated fully with the European Commission during its seven years of competition inquiry,?? it said. ??We maintain that our innovations in online shopping have been good for shoppers, retailers and competition in general.??"

Faster CellphonesThese days?it's tough to rack up a $62,000 cellphone bill just because your nephew wants to watch Wall-E, but data fees and caps are still a prime consideration for lots of wireless customers.?That should come to an end under the fifth-generation (5G) cellular standard,?a set of improvements expected to make data transfer up to 100 times faster than it is today while dramatically increasing bandwidth. Once the system is that efficient, worrying about how much data you used in a given month will seem as silly as worrying about the cost of a long-distance phone call.In November, Verizon said it'd bring 5G service to as many as five U.S. cities by the end of next year. T-Mobile promises?nationwide 5G coverage by 2020.?5G?may also serve as a credible alternative to local monopolies maintained by traditional internet service providers and cable companies, eventually adding an additional $3.2 trillion to the global economy?and?creating 22 million jobs worldwide by 2035. This should cheer you up if you're depressed by last week's?net neutrality rollback.2.?Smarter StuffWhen it comes to 5G, faster phones are the least exciting part of the story.?Right now, many?developments in artificial intelligence tend to be stuck in the labs?where the biggest, most powerful computers are located.?Even self-driving cars have to carry trunks full of expensive electronic brains. Reliable 5G could allow enough of that computing power to be done remotely to make driverless cars safer and cheaper, and make internet-connected medical devices?genuinely useful. Imagine, for instance, smart bandages that monitor the healing of a wound,?alerting your doctor if it becomes infected, or internet-connected glucose monitors that use sophisticated machine learning algorithms to tailor?treatment?for?diabetes patients. (There will be security concerns, of course.)3.?Bigger?BatteriesPartly because phones keep getting more powerful,?most still need recharging before the end of the day. Improved?manufacturing processes, however, have made batteries?cheaper and?much more useful than they've ever been. Earlier this year, while blackouts were plaguing southern Australia, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk boasted on Twitter that he would?build a 100-megawatt battery facility in 100 days, ??or it is free.?? The Aussies took him up on it, and despite?Musk's tendency to set unrealistic goals,?Tesla delivered?the world's biggest battery one day early. (This might count as two reasons: Elon?Musk hit a deadline!)There are other large-scale battery projects on the way, including an even bigger one?Hyundai is building in South Korea, scheduled to open in February. The speed with which these facilities are being built suggests that wind and solar power are a more realistic replacement for fossil fuels than most people realize, as long as Tesla and others are able to work out manufacturing kinks.4.?A New Space RaceMusk's other company, SpaceX, hit a big milestone Friday.?For the first time, it sent?a reused spaceship to the International Space Station on top of a reused rocket, which in the long run could mean?dramatically reduced?launch cost. SpaceX's?next-generation rocket, Falcon Heavy, could fly?as early as January. Meanwhile, Planet Labs is democratizing satellites, Rocket Lab is trying to further slash?launch costs, and Jeff Bezos is doing what Jeff Bezos does best?on behalf of his rocket company, Blue Origin.5.?Cheaper StuffEconomies of scale are an underappreciated side effect of Bezos'?growing wealth and power. Recently, New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo described how the online retailer??which just so happens to be trying to jump into pretty much every other industry and increasingly looks like a target for antitrust regulators??had?enabled no-name startups to undercut the big electronics companies. Wyze?Labs, for instance, makes an internet-connected video camera and sells it for $26, including shipping; a similar product sold by Alphabet's Nest division?costs $200.As Manjoo wrote,?Amazon has essentially superseded?the typical value of product brands (building trust, setting up a sales infrastructure, marketing). Customers?who don't go to stores and buy based on Amazon reviews essentially get to keep the money brands once invested in those things. That's sad for Nest, I suppose, but it's arguably pretty great for cash-strapped parents who can get an internet-connected video camera for the same price as a traditional baby monitor.6.?Bitcoin!You can't use bitcoin on Amazon, or for much?of anything at the moment besides speculation. But that's only half the story.For a second, let's forget?the crazy runup, ignore the?bitcoin lottery winners, and just marvel that bitcoin mania happened in the first place.?At a time when a handful of giant companies and their billionaire founders control?the technology landscape, a group of misfits led by a creator?nobody knows?managed to popularize a technology that may fundamentally change how Wall Street moves?money around, how we vote, and how we organize ourselves. Bitcoin could turn out to be a total bust in every way, but the fact that it happened shows the internet is still capable of producing things that are genuinely new.7.?New-New MediaOutside of patent lawsuits, the big tech companies often act like rent-seekers in the media business, where Google and Facebook swallow most of the new digital ad money and wield that power poorly.?Squint hard enough, though, and you'll see some reasons for optimism. While?Snap Inc. has performed poorly as a public company, Snapchat has done an admirable job of keeping free of fake news. Another bright spot: Patreon, which combines aspects of Kickstarter and the NPR pledge drive?to help support tens of thousands of podcasters, filmmakers, and other artists. And then there's the hot startup of the moment, HQ Trivia, an interactive game show that you can play on your iPhone. It's not world-changing stuff, but it's entertainment that feels genuinely novel without sucking up huge amounts of time.??????7?.?Tech Gets a Social Conscience,?MaybeAs cringeworthy?and depressing as the stories about sexism in?Silicon Valley have been, it's possible to see the outrage they've provoked as a sort of turning point for an industry?that?finally seems to be getting serious about its place in the world. Susan Fowler's blog post about?sexual harassment at Uber?drove investors and the press to confront the company's moral failures,?helping to?pave the way?for the flood of revelations about men in other industries. And while Facebook has never looked worse than it does today, Mark Zuckerberg is showing signs of the humility?that his company,?and the broader industry, desperately need.?It?may not be?much, but it is something. Here's to a happier 2018."
Atos Bids $5.1 Billion for Gemalto to Form French Tech Giant,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/atos-offers-to-acquire-gemalto-for-4-3-billion-euros,"December 11, 2017, 4:07 PM EST",technology,"""Cash offer is friendly but unsolicited; Gemalto is studying it"", ""Bid comes after tough year for security-software maker Gemalto""","Atos SE made a?4.3-billion-euro ($5.06 billion) unsolicited bid for?Gemalto NV with the backing of the French state's investment bank, seeking to create a European leader in cybersecurity, digital technologies and payment services.Atos is proposing to pay 46 euros a share in cash, 36 percent above Monday's closing price. It called the offer friendly and said it wants to engage in discussions about a deal, which would be the biggest of the year between two European technology companies.?Gemalto, a security software company that's seen its stock battered this year?by a series of profit warnings and operational setbacks, said it's?reviewing the proposal, which it described as conditional.Thierry Breton, the former French finance minister who runs Atos, said the company is ??absolutely determined?? to complete the transaction, and that it has the backing of?Gemalto's biggest shareholder, state-run investor Bpifrance Financement SA.?A representative for Bpifrance said the fund won't comment on Atos's bid, but welcomes consolidation of French technology players.Gemalto's shares had dropped 38 percent this year through Monday, after a March cut in outlook, an April warning that demand from U.S. banks was dipping, a July announcement of an impairment charge, and a delay in September in presenting a new strategic plan. Atos, by contrast, had seen its stock jump 24 percent in the same period.??We continue to do this on a friendly basis, but we are absolutely determined and we will do this transaction, because it's good for Gemalto shareholders, because it's good for Gemalto's stakeholders and because it's good for Atos shareholders,?? Breton said Tuesday on a call with analysts.?Atos has been on a buying spree in recent years in a bid to enter new regions and add a broader range of products, including in health care.?And Gemalto's shift from SIM cards to software and cybersecurity had initially paid off under Olivier Piou, the company's previous chief executive officer, with the shares trading at about 60 euros when he announced his retirement last year.?However, his successor, Philippe Vallee, has faced mounting challenges as it became clear that the company had overestimated the pace at which customers would shift to new technologies, especially the transition to chip-and-PIN bank cards in the U.S.Shares of Gemalto climbed 34 percent to 45.38 euros at 2 p.m. in Amsterdam. Atos gained 6 percent to 132.05 euros in Paris.Gemalto said it will review the bid and determine the best course of action before responding by Friday. The company has retained Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. as an adviser and said there is no certainty the proposal will lead to a firm offer. While Gemalto is incorporated in Amsterdam, it was formed from the combination more than a decade ago of French and Luxembourg companies, and is run from France.German billionaire siblings Susanne Klatten and Stefan Quandt, whose investment companies combined own a bit more than 10 percent of Gemalto, will study the Atos offer ??with care and composure,?? a Quandt family spokesman said in an emailed statement. ??As significant shareholders, we're pleased that others too are recognizing the technological quality of Gemalto.??The acquisition would be Atos's largest since it was formed in 1997 from the merger of two French companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Breton said?on a conference call with reporters on Monday he's?already secured financing from two banks for the deal. Atos will seek ??industrial partnerships?? to help turn around Gemalto's troubled SIM business, he said.??The deal would make sense even if management should give us more details on the strategy going forward and what it would do with some of Gemalto's assets that could be non-core for Atos,?? analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux wrote in a note. ??Atos should now convince Gemalto shareholders to tender.??Atos currently gets just 5.7 percent of its 11.7 billion-euro annual revenue from its big data and cybersecurity division. The French company beefed up its offering when it agreed to buy Siemens AG's communications cybersecurity division in October.?Gemalto generated annual sales of 3.1 billion euros in 2016.??

Google Blocks YouTube Access From Amazon's Streaming Devices,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/google-blocks-youtube-access-from-amazon-s-streaming-devices,"December 5, 2017, 4:02 PM EST",technology,"""YouTube app to be removed from retailer's Echo Show, Fire TV"", ""Amazon doesn't sell some Google hardware, latest Nest products""","Alphabet Inc.'s Google pulled support for its YouTube video service from Amazon.com Inc.'s streaming-media devices, citing the internet retailer's failure to make Amazon Prime Video available through Google's gadgets and the recent halt of the sale of some Nest products on its website.Google blocked YouTube access via the Echo Show, Amazon's smart speaker with a touchscreen, on Tuesday and will stop supporting YouTube on Amazon's Fire TV set-top box on Jan. 1. In a statement, a Google representative said it's taking the action because the YouTube apps on Amazon products aren't made by Google, like the YouTube app on the iPhone is, and the retail giant doesn't sell some Google products, such as Chromecast and Google Home.??We've been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other's products and services,"" Google said in a statement. In its own statement, Seattle-based Amazon said its gadgets now send users to the YouTube website, and the company hopes to resolve the dispute as soon as possible.The rivalry between Google and Amazon has heated up as the search giant and online retailer have moved quickly into hardware and internet services. In the past few years, both have introduced multiple new home devices, including speakers and home-security products. Both have also been pushing their own video and music-streaming services as well as competing video-control platforms. They also both offer corporate cloud-computing services, a market where Amazon leads by a wide margin.The video-streaming access fight has been brewing for some time. In September, Google blocked YouTube support for the Echo Show and at the time said Amazon's implementation ""violates our terms of service, creating a broken user experience."" This was resolved in November for Echo Show users, when Amazon began forwarding people using that device to a stripped-down third-party app that leveraged the YouTube website, instead of a native app. Then, last month, Amazon pulled Nest's latest devices, including its cheaper thermostat, from its online store. The Chromecast streaming product was removed from Amazon.com in 2015.??Echo Show and Fire TV now display a standard web view of YouTube.com and point customers directly to YouTube's existing website,?? Amazon said in the statement. ??Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website.??Mountain View, California-based Google isn't the only competitor that has seen its products blocked from Amazon's site. After being pulled from the No. 1 e-commerce site in 2015, the Apple TV box reappeared on the retail website in September, only to vanish again. Apple Inc., meantime, said Amazon Prime Video would become available as an app for Apple TV by the end of the year, but it hasn't yet been released.For more on Google, check out the?Decrypted? podcast:"

The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer quickly deleted the post.The tweet invited speculation that Musk, 46, may have been trying to recruit Carmack or was seeking ways for Oculus to cooperate with any of the many businesses he runs. Those include the electric-car maker Tesla, rocket company SpaceX, artificial intelligence researcher OpenAI, brain-computer interface developer Neuralink and tunnel digger The Boring Company.A Facebook spokeswoman said Carmack doesn't plan to leave the company.

After spending millions, he shuttered it in 2013. Still, he's maintained an interest in the sector and has interacted with Musk over Twitter before. In January 2015, Musk tweeted photos of a SpaceX drone-landing ship at Carmack and said his motivation was to get the programmer back into aerospace technology, TechCrunch reported at the time.A call placed to the number that Musk tweeted on Tuesday went to voicemail and played a message from the video game God of War. ??By the Gods you've done it,?? the message intones. ??Somehow you've found your way here to me.

Stem Cells Meet AI in Quest to Mass-Produce Key Disease Fighters,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/in-canada-s-stem-cell-factory-ai-would-help-patrol-the-line,"December 12, 2017, 6:00 AM EST",technology,"""General Electric, Trudeau government have invested in mission"", ""Toronto's health and tech ecosystem lures capital and brains""","A half-century ago, Canadian scientists discovered transplantable stem cells, which can grow into any kind of human tissue. Now, a government-backed research facility in Toronto wants to create a partially automated factory that would mass-produce these human building blocks into disease-fighting cells -- a process that is currently slow and labor-intensive.Toronto's Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine aims to lead the effort, which is expected to take several years because large-scale commercialization will require new technologies and automation.?CCRM and?General Electric Co.'s health division have set up a lab in Toronto to develop technology and processes that could potentially be used in the factory -- although GE hasn't yet committed to help build it.A GE bioreactor at the Centre?for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine.??This is Canada's chance to own stem cell manufacturing,?? says CCRM President Michael May,?adding that the tech developed in the lab could be exported globally. ??We're putting together all the processes and equipment for a blueprint for cell manufacturing in the future.??May's dream factory won't just manufacture stem cells; it will engineer many types of cells that are required to fight various diseases. Cell therapies are starting to show real promise. In August, for example, Novartis AG won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a blood cancer cell therapy, called CAR-T, which involves re-engineering a patient's own cells. The discovery has resulted in an 83 percent remission rate among clinical patients who had mostly run out of options and heralded a new era of cures, despite the $475,000 price tag on the treatment.Toronto's Centre?for Commercialization of Regenerative MedicineCanada isn't alone in its ambitions. Drug companies have already built their own stem cell factories, and countries like Japan are also keen to do so. But Canada, already a leader in artificial intelligence, is well positioned to do the same in cell therapies, which can do things like help the immune system attack cancers, or get defective cells to replace missing or damaged proteins. Toronto, the nation's most populous city, hosts one of the highest concentrations of hospitals and biotech researchers in the world. Canada's stem cell sector has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital, including a $225 million funding round for cell-therapy startup BlueRock Therapeutics from German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG and Silicon Valley-based Versant Ventures Management LLC.?With drug companies working on scores of therapies, demand for stem cells is soaring. Billions of cells are needed for clinical trials alone. But manufacturing stem cells is a laborious process, says?Aaron Dulgar-Tulloch, a director at GE Healthcare, who's currently working at the CCRM-GE lab. A skilled technician must carefully put the cells in a small bowl and feed them, transfer them to a special environment with ideal temperature and oxygen levels.?As they grow, the cells must be checked constantly because they are sensitive to contamination and their growth can be stunted if they're not treated in a precise manner under perfect conditions.Toronto's Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine?The process takes weeks, and one person might generate enough material for a single person's therapy. But as more therapies come online and the pool of patients expands to tens of thousands there's simply not enough talent or labs in the world to produce enough material, Dulgar-Tulloch says.The Canadian cell factory will be partly automated, speeding up the process and making it possible to grow many more cells at once. The wealth of data generated from current cell facilities will be used to train artificial intelligence algorithms, which in turn will ensure that the billions of cells are being cultivated under ideal conditions.?The computers will learn over time and help optimize the production of cell-based therapies.The GE and CCRM lab is located in the Toronto MaRS Discovery district, a 1.5 million square foot building that houses industry leaders, including the Google-backed Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Johnson & Johnson's innovation hub.?Acorn Biolabs Inc., a startup that has developed the first take-home kit to cryopreserve human cells, recently moved its headquarters to MaRS from Waterloo-Kitchener to be close to the AI and stem cell hub.The Trudeau government offers tax breaks to research-intensive industries, fast-track visas to high-skilled workers and increased funding for innovation across the board. CCRM and GE have benefited from some of these policies and have recruited several foreign high-skilled workers from China, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. to their Toronto lab.MaRS Discovery DistrictGE's $18 billion health unit does everything from making medical imaging equipment to drug discovery, and represents a big push by the company into healthcare technology. GE is pouring money into advancing cell-based therapies that can ultimately be transferred to commercial factories for mass production, including the one CCRM envisions for the future.??This is really an opportunity for Canada to position?itself and generate that ecosystem while the field is still maturing,?? Dulgar-Tulloch says. ??There is no country in the world that can say ??we have already locked this down and we're the region of choice for cell therapy and regenerative medicine' because the field is just too new and it's still developing.??"

He said Adyen hasn't selected bankers or targeted an IPO date, but declined to discuss further details. The company's private investors aren't pushing to cash out their holdings because the company, unlike some fast-growing tech startups, is profitable -- and therefore doesn't need to keep asking for additional funding, he said Thursday.Iconiq Capital, a multifamily wealth management firm whose investors have included Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter Inc. co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, invested in Adyen in 2015, valuing it at $2.3 billion at the time. The 11-year-old company, while not a household name, has quietly grown to handle $90 billion in transactions last year. It's competing in a crowded market with PayPal Holdings Inc. and Stripe Inc. among others.With revenue of $727 million in 2016, almost doubling the amount from a year earlier, Adyen could command a high valuation when it lists.

Russia Wins in Arctic After U.S. Fails to Kill Giant Gas Project,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/russia-dreams-big-as-u-s-fails-to-kill-27-billion-gas-project,"December 14, 2017, 3:08 AM EST",business,"""Sanctions created ‘deadlock' for Yamal LNG, says Total"", ""Novatek plans new projects to challenge Qatar for scale""","Building the $27 billion Yamal liquefied natural gas project meant shipping more than 5 million tons of materials to construct a forest of concrete and steel 600 kilometers north of the Arctic circle, where temperatures can drop to -50 degrees celsius and the sun disappears for two months straight.Yet those challenges weren't as tough as the?U.S. sanctions imposed in 2014, forcing a complete refinancing just as construction was about to start. Jacques de Boisseson, head of the Moscow office of French energy giant Total SA, which has a 20 percent stake in Yamal LNG, said there were ""various moments"" when he thought the project may never happen.""We were too much advanced to stop. We were in a deadlock: we had to go ahead and we didn't know how,"" de Boisseson said.Yamal LNG shipping scenarios.Three years later, the first shipment of Yamal LNG's gas represents a gargantuan effort from the Russian establishment to demonstrate that one of President Vladimir Putin's flagship projects would not be derailed by sanctions. The launch of the project in the face of sanctions has helped spur Moscow's political pivot to China, which provided much of the financing. Novatek PJSC, which controls Yamal LNG, is already talking about its next LNG project.The first cargo is on board a tanker headed for a port near London, helping the U.K. to cope with cold winter weather and an unplanned shutdown of a clutch of its own North Sea fields. That the gas will end up in a European country that's backed sanctions against Russia may please many in Moscow.""We had a dream,"" Mark Gyetvay, deputy chief executive officer of Novatek, said on Tuesday. ""Now we have realized that dream.""For Yamal LNG, the timing of the U.S. sanctions against Russian shareholders in the project in 2014 couldn't have been worse. It was just embarking on?one of Russia's largest-ever international financing packages, and planning to attract significant investment from western banks. In a further obstacle, the sanctions prevented Novatek's Gyetvay from working on the financing deal as he is a U.S. citizen.??For Novatek, it's a triumph over adversity,""?said James Henderson,?director of natural gas at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. ??Russians have got it running and that is a bit of a triumph for them that underlines again that sanctions struggle to be effective.""Yamal's partners hoped that non-U.S. banks and companies would step into the breach and provide the necessary financial support. But talks dragged on through 2014 and 2015 without a deal, as few were willing to risk the wrath of the U.S. government by helping to fund the project, and a tumble in oil prices changed the economic calculus.China was the only hope remaining besides Russia's state banks. But those negotiations were just as tortuous. Novatek several times made predictions about when a deal would be signed, only to see the self-imposed deadlines pass without a result.??Quite frankly, we are beginning to lose our patience with the excessive comments and a myopic focus on the single point,?? Gyetvay told analysts in October 2015, conceding that the process had been ??painstakingly slow.??Russia was forced to backstop the project, providing 150 billion rubles ($2.5 billion) of funding from the National Welfare Fund,?a rainy-day reserve built up to stabilize retirement provisions, in a high-stakes show of support.Finally in April 2016, two Chinese state banks agreed to provide $12 billion to the project in euros and rubles.??There was a period of uncertainty,?? Gyetvay said on Tuesday. ??And then when China came in that ended.??Novatek's achievement was not just one of political willpower and financial engineering. It was also technical.Putin, officially opening the plant in the harsh climate of northern Siberia last week, told an audience including Gazprom PJSC chief Alexey Miller that several people had come to him with a list of reasons why it couldn't work. ??This is certainly a complex project, and we have good people here in this room, good professionals, who warned me at the beginning of this journey: ??Do not do this',?? he said.Gazprom had previously considered building an LNG plant in the same region but concluded it was too challenging. Other big LNG projects around the world have suffered large budget over-runs.??It's the only project I can think of in the last decade that actually is on time and on budget,?? said Henderson at the Oxford Institute. ??It's pretty impressive.??That wasn't all the result of the engineering prowess of Novatek and partners Total and CNPC. The project was helped by a tumble in the ruble in late 2014 ?C cutting the cost of Russia-sourced equipment and labour at a key moment in the construction.What's more, it received large amounts of Russian government support, not only in the form of financing. Yamal LNG also enjoys generous tax breaks, and the state has helped to build some of the necessary infrastructure.For Novatek, the successful launch of the project means questions are now turning to the future. On Tuesday, it outlined plans for some $60 billion of investments together with partners in a second LNG plant, a trans-shipment terminal in the far east and new domestic gas supplies.??Today is a great moment for Novatek,?? Gyetvay said. ??Our new strategy transforms Novatek into a global gas power.??"
Brexit Refugees Heading to Amsterdam Raise Local Housing Concern,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/brexit-refugees-heading-to-amsterdam-raise-local-housing-concern,"December 12, 2017, 11:05 PM EST",business,"""Dutch capital has only about 3,000 houses for sale or rent"", ""EMA people expected to spread across greater Amsterdam area""","Follow @Brexit for all the latest news, and sign up to our daily Brexit Bulletin newsletter.If Brexit refugees moving to Amsterdam from London have their sights set on owning one of the city's famed canal-facing houses, they're in for a disappointment.Not only are there very few of those coveted homes on the market, the city only has about 1,000 houses and apartments of any kind for sale.Traditional Dutch properties in Amsterdam.With the Dutch capital picked as the new base of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and as authorities in the city of about 850,000 work on luring fintech firms, banks and companies to move regional operations from London to Amsterdam,?some locals are raising the alarm over a further tightening of an already difficult property market. Prices are hitting record highs.??The market is already heavily overheated,?? said Sven Heinen, chairman of Amsterdam's real estate association MVA, from his office in the hip central neighborhood De Pijp, home to Heineken NV's brewery, now a tourist attraction. Like around Amsterdam's four famous canals, availability has plummeted in his neighborhood. ??Demand is many times larger than the supply.??Heinen sees Brexit-driven newcomers pushing prices even higher. In the third quarter, home prices in the city jumped 17 percent?from the same period a year earlier to an average of 378,000 euros ($445,000), according to?the organization of real estate agents and appraisers NVM. That compares with 265,000 euros in 2008 before the financial crisis sent prices tumbling.In all, including the Amsterdam neighborhoods north of the River IJ and Zuidoost, a melting pot of cultures southeast of the city, the supply consists of only about 1,244 homes.??If half of the 900 EMA employees want to buy a home in Amsterdam, that's already about half of the supply,?? said Heinen.The EMA is not the only entity moving to Amsterdam because of Brexit. So far, companies, including Radix Trading LLC, Quantlab, and Royal Bank of Scotland have picked the city for a foothold on the continent. Within three years, these companies expect to employ 915 people.?Additionally, the EMA in the U.K. has an ecosystem around it of at least 1,000 companies, including drug developers and other medical firms that want to be close to the agency to facilitate talks. Some of these companies are now reaching out to Amsterdam. The city is also in talks with 80 other firms that could move headquarters or branch offices, Udo Kock, the city's deputy mayor in charge of economic affairs, said in an interview.Even without Brexit, the city had planned to add 50,000 more homes by 2025. Twenty percent of these will be for sale and for high-end rentals and 40 percent for the mid-level segment, according to a plan unveiled in 2017. The rest will comprise social housing.Amsterdam's rental market is tight. The city has just over 2,000 available private rental homes, according to Jasper de Groot, who captures 85 percent of the rental market with his platform Pararius. In contrast, Rightmove, one of the main house-hunting platforms in the U.K., has over 49,000 properties listed for sale in London and 50,000 for rent.Real estate agents point out that the Brexit-driven newcomers are used to a housing crunch given the exorbitant London market, and may also be more open moving farther afield from the center of Amsterdam.??These people look entirely differently at distances,?? said Heinen. ??If we Dutch have to sit in the car for about half an hour, we grab our agendas to maybe drop by a week later.??City authorities say the situation isn't as dire as it seems.??Amsterdam's ability to absorb is enormous,?? Kock said. Winning the EMA bid ??is fantastic news for Amsterdam, and we shouldn't exaggerate the impact on the housing market.??Amsterdam's metropolitan area stretches from roughly IJmuiden to Almere and Zaanstad to Aalsmeer,?an area housing some 2.5 million people. It includes towns like Oudekerk aan de Amstel and Badhoevedorp, where houses come with gardens for children to play.??It's good to be critical but I'd like to pose a question in return: should Amsterdam not have pitched for EMA??? Kock asked. The city expects the EMA win and the possible moves by other companies to boost Amsterdam's economy, creating jobs and demand for services.EMA staff, and others moving from London, are expected to rent first, making a tough market even tougher. This year, the number of hits from the U.K. on?Pararius's rental website was second only to visitors from the Netherlands.While Brexiters can escape the tight market, since they are likely to rent in the higher segment of properties priced above 1,500 euros a month, Dutch first-time renters may not be so lucky.??There is already an insufficient offer to house everybody who wants to live in Amsterdam,?? ING's consumer economist Senne Janssen said. ??I don't worry about wealthy companies and their people coming from abroad, such as the EMA employees, but rather fear starters will be pushed out of the city.??A listing by De Groot features a one-bedroom apartment, 45 square meters, in an up-and-coming neighborhood for 1,500 euros, excluding utilities, putting it beyond the reach of most first-time renters. His 352 other listings are not much better.??You aren't going to live there as a starter, right????said De Groot. ??And the police officer, the bus driver, teachers. Where are they going to live???"

Hedge Funds Try a Quant Approach to Tackling Cryptocurrencies,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/pantera-capital-tries-to-model-crypto-wild-west-with-quant-fund,"December 6, 2017, 11:54 AM EST",technology,"""Portfolio to hold mostly digital tokens from secondary market"", ""Of more than 100 crypto funds, only a few use quant strategies""","A daring few hedge funds are attempting to apply rules and models to the wildest market out there -- cryptocurrencies.There are now more than 100 cryptocurrency hedge funds that have launched in the past two years, but only a handful use quantitative analysis techniques, which rely on numbers crunching to identify opportunities and improve returns. The proliferation of portfolios and trading strategies reflects growing investor interest.One of the most prominent funds taking a quant approach comes from Dan Morehead's Pantera Capital Management, which started investing in bitcoin in 2014. Its first fundraising round closed on Oct. 31, and it started trading last month.??We expect institutions to get their initial exposure to crypto with this particular fund,???Pantera Vice President Paul Veradittakit said in an email. ??We believe that investors have different risk profiles, return expectations and liquidity preferences, so we've decided to create a menu of different investments strategies and products to cater to the masses.??The Pantera Digital Asset Fund is the firm's fourth?cryptocurrency portfolio and the first to invest mostly in digital tokens trading in the secondary market. The Pantera Bitcoin Fund invests only in bitcoin, the Pantera Venture Fund is a traditional venture capital fund, and the Pantera ICO Fund buys digital tokens before they're issued. The firm is managing over $400 million across the four different strategies.In addition, Pantera is applying factors often used in smart-beta investing, such as low volatility, sizing, betting against beta, and momentum, Veradittakit said.While quant analysis can help traders exploit ??massive inefficiencies?? in crypto markets, it will be hard to build models because the data's relatively limited, said Benjamin Dunn, president of the portfolio consulting practice at Alpha Theory, which works with money management firms.??Not sure how you approach a largely unregulated and emotional market where there's one, very limited history,?? Dunn said. ??I'd be curious how they're able to have any kind of predictability around a very limited data set as usually quaint models require a significant amount of data.??Read More: Even Robots Are Joining the Bitcoin Craze as Quants Seek an EdgeVeradittakit declined to disclose Pantera's quant fund returns, but said the firm tests its models against bitcoin, ether and other top crypto index funds, and ??our models have performed very well comparatively,?? he said.Bitcoin rallied more than 50 percent in November alone, while the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets Index, which includes the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, soared more than 60 percent.

Reports in South African media have alleged that MultiChoice had a corrupt relationship with ANN7, which the family sold earlier this year.??The investigation concerns whether Naspers and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices,?? Pomerantz said in a statement Tuesday.Naspers investors should contact the firm if they are concerned, Pomerantz said, without saying who had commissioned the company to start an investigation. A phone call to the firm's New York office wasn't answered out of business hours.The probe asks further questions about the involvement of Cape Town-based Naspers in the scandal surrounding the Guptas, who are accused of using their friendship with South African President Jacob Zuma to win lucrative state contracts. U.S. consultancy McKinsey & Co. and auditor KPMG LLP are among international companies to have found that work done for the family had breached corporate governance standards. The Guptas and Zuma deny any wrongdoing.The News24 website, which is also owned by Naspers, reported last month that MultiChoice increased its annual payment to ANN7 to 141 million rand ($10 million) from 50 million rand, citing leaked emails.

Yoshino, an honorary fellow at Asahi Kasei Corp.,?the world's biggest maker of separators used in batteries, said in an interview at the company headquarters in Tokyo. ??Durability will become very important.??To read about GM's plans for self-driving cars used for ride-sharing, click here.While producers should still focus on improving energy density and lowering costs, they will also need to create batteries using materials that can better withstand constant expansion and contraction, Yoshino said. The task becomes easier if there's less need to simultaneously boost energy density, which is the biggest factor for driving range, he said. Lithium titanate, for example, can be used in the anode of the battery, where carbon is used commonly now.EV share of global new car sales Source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance ??Cars are a completely new application, and we'll have to wait until we find out what kind of batteries will really be needed,?? Yoshino said. ??The future of batteries depends on what will happen to the future of the automobile society.??At Asahi Kasei's laboratory in the early 1980s, Yoshino began researching polyacetylene, a conducting polymer discovered by the Japanese chemist and Nobel Prize winner Hideki Shirakawa. Although the material could be used in solar panels and semiconductors, Yoshino focused on batteries as a wave of small electronic devices requiring powerful, rechargeable energy sources began hitting the market.Yoshino invented a prototype of the lithium-ion battery in 1985.He succeeded in building a lithium-ion battery using polyacetylene as the anode, later switching to carbon. But Sony Corp. beat Asahi Kasei in the race to commercialize it for mobile phones in 1991. The following year, Asahi Kasei formed a?venture with Toshiba Corp. to make and sell their own batteries.??I thought it would be a boon to tap into the 8 millimeter-video camera market,?? Yoshino said, referring to an outdated format. ??Mobile phones, laptops, and computers just kept multiplying, but no one was thinking about cars?? at that time, he said.That's since changed. Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects electric vehicles will account for 54 percent of new car sales by 2040. Highly autonomous cars are expected around 2020, but technical and legal challenges to mass-market use of fully autonomous cars won't be solved before 2030, BNEF said in a Dec. 1 report.Yoshino was a recipient?with three others of the 2014 Charles Stark Draper Prize for engineering for their contribution in the development of lithium-ion battery."

The GraniteShares Bitcoin ETF and the GraniteShares Short Bitcoin ETF would trade on the Cboe BZX exchange. The issuer, GraniteShares, is a New-York based provider of commodities ETFs.The proposal will come up against a regulator that has so far been leery of bitcoin ETFs. The SEC in March rejected a proposal to list the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, causing bitcoin's price to plummet at the time. Since then, bitcoin's price has soared more than 1,700 percent.?In the intervening months, other major changes have happened in the relationship between bitcoin and traditional financial firms.

Researchers Combat Gender and Racial Bias in Artificial Intelligence,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/researchers-combat-gender-and-racial-bias-in-artificial-intelligence,"December 4, 2017, 7:45 AM EST",technology,,"When?Timnit Gebru?was a student at?Stanford University's prestigious Artificial Intelligence Lab, she ran a project that used Google Street View images of cars to determine the demographic makeup of towns and cities across the U.S.? While the AI?algorithms did a credible job of predicting income levels and political leanings in a given?area,?Gebru?says her work was susceptible to bias??racial, gender, socio-economic.?She?was also horrified by a?ProPublica report that found?a computer program widely used to predict whether a criminal will re-offend?discriminated against people of color.So earlier this year, Gebru, 34, joined a?Microsoft Corp. team called?FATE??for Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics in AI.?The program was set up three years ago to ferret out biases that creep?into AI data and can skew results.??I started to realize that I have to start thinking about things like bias,???says Gebru, who co-founded Black in AI, a group set up to encourage?people of color to join the artificial intelligence field. ??Even my own Phd work suffers from whatever issues you&apos;d have with dataset bias.??In the popular imagination, the threat from AI tends to the alarmist: self-aware computers turning on their creators and taking over the planet. The reality (at least for now) turns out to be a lot more?insidious but no less concerning to the people working in AI labs around the world. Companies, government agencies and hospitals are increasingly turning to machine learning, image recognition and other AI tools to?help?predict everything from the credit worthiness of a loan applicant to the preferred treatment for a person suffering from cancer. The tools have big blind spots?that particularly effect women and minorities.???The worry is if we don&apos;t get this right, we could be making wrong decisions that have critical consequences to someone&apos;s life, health or financial stability,?? says Jeannette Wing, director of Columbia University&apos;s Data Sciences Institute.Researchers at Microsoft, International Business Machines Corp. and the University of Toronto identified the need for fairness in AI systems back in 2011. Now in the wake of several high-profile incidents??including an AI beauty contest that chose predominantly white faces as winners??some of the best minds in the business are working on the bias problem. The issue will be a key topic at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, an annual confab that starts today in Long Beach, California, and brings together AI scientists from around the world.AI is?only as good as the data?it learns from. Let's say programmers are building a computer model to identify dog breeds from?images. First they train the algorithms?with photos that are each tagged with breed names. Then they?put the program through its paces with untagged photos of Fido and Rover and let the algorithms name the breed based on what they learned from the training data. The programmers see what worked and what didn&apos;t and fine-tune from there.The algorithms?continue to learn and improve, and with?more time and data?are supposed to become more accurate. Unless bias intrudes.Bias can surface?in various ways. Sometimes the training data is insufficiently diverse, prompting?the software to guess based on what it???knows.?? In 2015, Google&apos;s photo?software infamously tagged?two black users ??gorillas?? because the data lacked enough examples of people of color. Even when?the data accurately mirrors reality the algorithms still get the answer wrong, incorrectly guessing a particular nurse in a photo or text is female, say,?because the data shows fewer men are nurses. In some cases the algorithms are trained to learn from the people using the software and, over time, pick up the biases of? the human users.?AI also has a disconcertingly human?habit of amplifying stereotypes. Phd?students at the University of Virginia and University of Washington?examined a public dataset of photos?and found that the images?of people cooking were 33 percent more likely to picture?women than men. When they ran the images through an AI model, the algorithms said women were 68?percent more likely to appear in the cooking photos.Eliminating bias isn't easy. Improving the training data?is one way.?Scientists at Boston University and Microsoft&apos;s New England lab zeroed in on so-called word embeddings??sets of data that serve as a kind of computer dictionary used by all manner of AI programs. In this case, the researchers were looking for gender bias that could lead algorithms to do things like conclude people named John would make better computer programmers than ones named Mary.?In a paper?called ""Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?"" the researchers?explain how they combed through the data, keeping?legitimate correlations (man is to king as woman is to queen, for one) and altering ones that were biased (man is to doctor as woman is to nurse). In doing so, they created a gender-bias-free public dataset and are now?working on one that removes racial biases.??We have to teach our algorithms which are good associations and which are bad the same way we teach our kids,???says Adam Kalai, a Microsoft researcher who co-authored?the paper.He and researchers including Cynthia?Dwork??the? academic behind the 2011 push towards AI fairness??have also proposed using different algorithms to classify two groups represented in a set of data, rather than trying to measure everyone with the same yardstick.?So for example, female engineering applicants can be evaluated by the criteria best suited to predicting a successful female engineer and not be excluded?because they don&apos;t meet criteria?that determine success for the larger group. Think of it as algorithmic affirmative action that gets the hiring manager qualified applicants without prejudice or sacrificing too much accuracy.While many researchers work on known problems, Microsoft&apos;s Ece Kamar and Stanford University&apos;s Himabindu Lakkaraju are trying to find black holes in the data. These ??unknown unknowns????a condundrum?made famous by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld??are the missing areas in a dataset the engineer or researcher doesn&apos;t even realize aren&apos;t there.Using a dataset with photos of black dogs and white and brown cats, the software incorrectly labeled a white dog as a cat. Not only was the AI wrong, it was very sure it was right, making it harder to detect the error. Researchers are looking for places where the software had high confidence in its decision, finding ?mistakes and noting?the features that characterize the error. That information is then provided to the system designer with examples they can use to retrain the algorithm.Researchers say it will probably take years to solve the bias problem. While they see promise in various approaches, they consider the challenge not simply technological but legal too because some of the solutions require treating protected classes differently, which isn&apos;t legal everywhere.What's more,?many?AI systems are black boxes; the data goes in and the answer comes out without an explanation for the decision. Not only does that make it difficult figuring?out how bias?creeps in; the opaqueness?also makes it hard for the person denied parole or the teacher labeled a low-performer to appeal because they have no way of knowing why that decision was reached.

Bitcoin Developer Behind Failed Fork Begins Another Offshoot,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/bitcoin-developer-behind-failed-fork-begins-another-offshoot,"December 12, 2017, 4:50 PM EST",technology,"""Core developer Jeff Garzik regroups after SegWit2x failure"", ""About 10 pecent of bitcoin mining has switched, Garzik says""","A new version of the bitcoin system has been formed after some developers split the blockchain, the digitized ledger on which the cryptocurrency lives. Called?UnitedBitcoin, the offshoot comes a month after an earlier effort failed to gain enough support.Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik, a proponent of the failed network upgrade known as SegWit2x, is leading to effort to increase capacity by raising block size to eight megabytes, as well as adding new smart contract features and support for the Lightning Network, which is a way to run more transactions.While independence from any central authority is part of bitcoin's appeal, that's also made it more susceptible to such so-called forks when there are differing visions within the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin miners and developers have been embroiled in a debate lately over an upgrade of its protocol that's aimed at speeding up transactions. A lack of consensus had led to the possible creation of at least a half dozen variations.About 10 percent of bitcoin's mining has switched to UnitedBitcoin, Garzik said in an interview. The effort has gained support of Chinese miners with older gear, which doesn't mine bitcoins as profitably any longer, particularly as difficulty of mining bitcoins just went up. Exchanges zb.com and Exx support UB as well, he said.QuickTake Q&A: The Forks and Fights Behind Bitcoin's Turbulence??This has come together very, very, very rapidly,?? Garzik said. ??This was put together by some miners and exchanges that were largely China-based that were facing this prospect we have this difficulty adjustment in bitcoin, and also we'd like to see innovation in bitcoin move much faster than it does.??UnitedBitcoin also offers replay protection, so people won't be able to spend their coins twice, Garzik said. The new coin also will use a sizable reserve to stabilize its price relative to fiat currencies -- effectively, competing with another service, called Tether, which recently reported that a hacker stole $31 million in tokens from it.Every bitcoin holder will get some UnitedBitcoin coins. Past splits had driven more people into bitcoin, to get the extra coins. Following prior splits, bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold, the new coins have appreciated, and so did bitcoin. (Bitcoin also soared in November, after SegWit2x, was called off.) This split also has a new feature: Owners of ether, qtum and h-shares will get some UBs as well, Garzik said.""That automatically brings people into the community,"" Garzik said."

The participating banks hope to make a decision in the coming months whether to go ahead with the project, one person said.Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has repeatedly singled out compliance as an area where automation could help save costs. The lender said earlier this year that know-your-customer rules have become so expensive that they force banks to reduce activities in some areas, for example financing in developing countries.The joint project, which was reported earlier Monday by Sueddeutsche Zeitung, comes less than a month after Deutsche Bank announced it is partnering with IBM Corp on a blockchain-based KYC platform that lets banks collect and share client information."
Nintendo Opens Games to Rival Console for First Time With Nvidia,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/nintendo-opens-games-to-rival-console-for-first-time-with-nvidia,"December 5, 2017, 10:52 PM EST",technology,"""Super Mario and Zelda games to be released for Nvidia Shield"", ""China is the world's largest gaming market by revenue""","For the first time ever, Nintendo Co.'s games will be playable on?gaming hardware that wasn't made by the Japanese company.In a new initiative limited to China, Nintendo has begun distributing classic Wii and Gamecube titles through Nvidia Corp.'s gaming tablet Shield, the?Kyoto-based game maker said in a statement. The device went on sale Dec. 5 in mainland China with three classic Nintendo games, including?The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Punch-Out!!, which were released globally roughly a decade ago.It's a significant shift for Nintendo, which has kept its home-grown games exclusively for its own home and handheld consoles since the early 1980s. The maker of Wii, DS and Switch machines only reluctantly began releasing mobile titles for third-party smartphones last year. With China surpassing the U.S. as the world's largest gaming market, pressure has been building on Nintendo to bring its titles to the mainland.??We're very happy to have this opportunity to let our entertainment products bring joy to the vast body of Chinese players,?? Nintendo said in the statement, issued in Chinese. More classic titles will be released next year and will receive visual upgrades, it said. ??Due to Nvidia's excellent staff, these games will get high-resolution ports.??A Nintendo spokesman said the agreement is limited to China and the Nvidia Shield, and isn't indicative of a broader strategic change. He said efforts to bring its new Nintendo Switch hybrid console to China continues independently of its partnership with Nvidia.Until now, the majority of Nintendo games haven't been legally available in China, limiting the popularity of Super Mario and Donkey Kong, which are household names in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Instead, mainland China is dominated by personal-computer and mobile gaming titles such as Playerunknown's Battlegrounds and Honour of Kings. China's gaming market generated $24.6 billion in revenue last year, compared with $24.1 billion in the U.S.There are still barriers for non-Chinese game publishers to release titles in the country, including state censorship and the need to establish joint ventures with local partners. Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. and have achieved limited success since releasing their consoles on the mainland since 2014, partly due to the declining popularity of console gaming and the absence of blockbuster titles such as Grand Theft Auto V, which are are banned for its violent and sexual content.Nintendo's family-friendly lineup means it may fare better with China's censors. In September, it announced plans to release Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s Honour of Kings for Nintendo Switch. That spurred speculation the Chinese web and gaming giant will help Nintendo tap the mainland market. Nintendo's spokesman declined to say when the Nintendo Switch might go on sale in China.Nvidia Shield was introduced in 2014 globally as a portable gaming device, but has seen limited success. It's similar to a tablet, but is capable of better graphics and can be connected to a TV and played with a controller. That's roughly same idea behind Nintendo's Switch, which also combines home and portable gaming. Nintendo has sold 7.6 million units since it went on sale in March, becoming its biggest product success in a decade and helping to double the Japanese company's stock price.??For Nintendo, their main goal is probably to have their intellectual property recognized more in China,?? said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. But as the Chinese console market is limited, ??there won't be much impact to Nintendo's earnings.???? With assistance by David Ramli, and Yuan Gao"

Known as CRS-13, the mission will deliver critical cargo to and from the orbiting lab for NASA, the company said.SpaceX landed the rocket's first stage on land for reuse in a future launch. Once derided as a crazy idea, reusability in space flight is now seen as key to making launches affordable.The mission was the first in more than a year from Space Launch Complex 40, the Florida pad that suffered significant damage when a Falcon 9 rocket exploded there in September 2016. SpaceX's $50 million refurbishment of the damaged site will allow the company led by Musk to further ramp up its launch cadence in 2018.SpaceX had delayed the mission to conduct additional checks, inspections and cleanings after it detected particles in one of its rocket's fueling systems."

Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast spokeswoman, said in an email.As the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission prepares to lift Obama-era rules enforcing ""net neutrality,"" the pledges from Comcast and other internet-service providers to not take advantage of the newfound freedom by charging content providers extra for ""fast lanes"" is being greeted with skepticism.Internet service providers ??want to do paid prioritization,?? Tom Wheeler, who passed the rules in 2015 when he served as the FCC's Democratic chairman, said in an interview.He and others point to the recent disappearance from Comcast's website of a pledge not to create fast lanes. ??Something like this is no happenstance,?? Wheeler said.Read More: Why Trump Wants to Toss Obama's Net Neutrality RulesWith a vote on Dec. 14, the FCC is set to let broadband providers such as Comcast and AT&T Inc. block or slow internet traffic and offer fast lanes for websites that pay more. It's a win for internet service providers who say the utility-style regulation has slowed investment and discouraged innovation. They've lobbied and litigated against the rules yet still forecast little change in their operations.Skeptics raise the specter of an internet driven more by deep pockets than bright ideas, with established businesses buying even more dominance. For instance, broadband providers could slow the likes of Netflix Inc. or Dish Network Corp.'s Sling TV, or charge the streaming video companies fees that startups couldn't afford.The repeal push comes from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who was named by President Donald Trump, and has won support from the other two members of the agency's Republican majority, ensuring passage. Pai has said another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, will protect competition and consumers, and the agencies plan to work together.""It's naive not to recognize the incentives,?? said Dane Jasper, chief executive officer of Sonic, a Santa Rosa, California-based provider of internet service to about 100,000 residential customers in California.The Latest: AT&T, Comcast Win as Trump's FCC Urges End of Web RuleJasper said companies such as AT&T, which owns DirecTV, and Comcast, which owns NBC, have a motive to discourage customers from using the likes of Netflix, Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime video, Dish's Sling TV or Sony Inc.'s PlayStation Vue.Jasper in an interview identified another incentive that could work to damp competition: If large broadband companies can extract a fee from the likes of Netflix, the internet service providers can lower the monthly fee charged to consumers. Companies the size of Sonic don't have the leverage to demand a fee from content providers, leaving them without leeway to lower prices to compete, he said.???I'm going to be forced to offer the service for more,?? Jasper said.More on the FCC: Twitter Slapped as FCC Chief Takes a Swipe at Silicon ValleyA trade group of broadband providers?including AT&T and Comcast pledged last week to not block or slow web traffic and otherwise avoid ??unfair discrimination against lawful traffic online,?? according to a statement. The group, Broadband for America, also represents companies including the largest wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc.Comcast changed the language about its web practices that is posted on a corporate page in late April, as Pai was announcing his intention to gut the Obama-era rules. The altered wording was reported earlier by the online publication Ars Technica.Last month after Pai announced details, the company's Senior Executive Vice President David Cohen wrote in a blog post: ??Comcast's commitment to our customers remains the same: we do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies.??Other carriers made similar pledges.??From a customer perspective, I don't see much changing,?? John Stephens, AT&T's chief financial officer, told investors at a conference Dec. 5. ??We believe in not blocking or advantaging one's website over others, that's not what we do.??AT&T Suit Shows Web Has Enough Rules, Open Internet Foes SayAt Verizon, spokesman Rich Young said that ??our internet customers will continue to be able to go where they want and do what they want online.??The companies don't need to offer fast lanes because networks are delivering all types of data so quickly that even users who wait in line behind others suffer only a negligible delay, said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics LLC.Paid prioritization would amount to ??somebody paying money for nothing,?? Entner said.Broadband providers won't assemble packages of favored web channels, excluding others, because consumers won't accept ??a walled garden,?? Entner said. ??It's a non-starter in markets where there's competition.??About 61 percent of Americans don't have a choice of competing fixed-line broadband providers, according to the FCC.Still, web companies express apprehension about broadband providers' plans.??They want to sell special capability and have people pay for it. And those who can't pay for it will lack the same access,?? Ed Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said in an interview. ??There will be innumerable ways to do that, sometimes shrouded, sometimes defended as technically efficient.???Members of Black's Washington-based trade group include Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Amazon.com, Dish Network and online ride hailing service Uber Technologies Inc.Black mocked pledges of good behavior.""??Oh, we're not going to do anything!'"" Black said. ??Then why did you make it the most unbelievably high priority -- millions in lobbying, millions in PR campaigns?""?Several analysts said they expect few changes before Pai's rules relaxation has been tested in court. A challenge is all but inevitable, and it's not certain federal courts will accept the Republicans overturning a rule passed less than three years ago by Democrats.?""I'd be surprised if they did anything until a court rules,"" said Blair Levin, a former FCC official under Democrats. ??They haven't told Wall Street how they could make money, and usually companies are not shy about that.????This is a bad thing for the entire internet ecosystem,?? David Schaeffer, chief executive officer of Cogent Communications Holdings Inc., which provides links between companies and data networks, told investors Dec. 4.??What these rules will allow companies to do is, choose whether or not for their end users, they will have adequate connections.

Sherman and his wife shocked the country's corporate and political worlds.The bodies of the 75-year-old founder of Apotex Pharmaceutical Holdings Inc. and his wife Honey Sherman were found in their home in the Toronto neighborhood of North York on Friday under what police called suspicious circumstances.Tributes poured in from prominent Canadians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. As media reports citing anonymous sources surfaced Saturday, the Shermans' children issued a statement?calling for a full criminal investigation, and criticizing the police and the media.??We are shocked and think it's irresponsible that police sources have reportedly advised the media of a theory which neither their family, their friends nor their colleagues believe to be true,?? the Shermans' children said. They derided ??rumors?? about the circumstances of the parents' deaths, adding that the pair ??shared an enthusiasm for life.????We urge the Toronto Police Service to conduct a thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation, and urge the media to refrain from further reporting as to the cause of these tragic deaths until the investigation is completed,?? the family said in the statement.Toronto police were waiting on autopsy results, which were expected on Saturday, before determining if the service's homicide unit would take over the case.??We are treating the deaths as suspicious,?? Toronto Police Constable David Hopkinson said in a phone interview. Investigators aren't searching for any suspects at this time, he said.Tributes flooded in as news of the Shermans' deaths spread. ??Our condolences to their family & friends, and to everyone touched by their vision & spirit,?? Trudeau wrote on Twitter.In a statement on Saturday, Apotex hailed Sherman's role in growing the company from a two-person firm in 1974 to a global giant -- one of the world's largest generic drug makers, employing some 11,000 people including more than 6,000 in Canada.Sherman ??gave his life to the singular purpose of our organization -- innovating for patient affordability,?? Apotex said in the statement. ??Patients around the world live healthier and more fulfilled lives thanks to his life's work.??Sherman, who had a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was chairman of the closely held Canadian generic-drug maker and formerly chair of Cangene Corp., a Canadian biotechnology firm. He was ranked recently by Forbes as Canada's 12th-richest person with a net worth of about $3 billion.The billionaire held a fundraiser for Trudeau in August 2015, shortly before his Liberals won the election, that was later reportedly investigated by the country's lobbying watchdog.Linda Frum, a Canadian senator who recently awarded a medal to Honey Sherman for community service, was among those paying tribute to someone she described as one of the most beloved members of Canada's Jewish community.??I am gutted by the loss of Honey and Barry Sherman. Our community is steeped in grief. I am heartbroken,?? she said on Twitter.Eric Hoskins, health minister of Ontario province, described the couple as ??incredible philanthropists?? and said he was ??beyond words right now.?? Brad Duguid, Ontario's minister for economic development, said he was ??deeply shocked & saddened.??The Shermans' 12,440-square-foot home had recently been placed on the market for almost C$7 million ($5.4 million)."
Twitter Bans Some White Supremacists and Other Extremists,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/twitter-bans-some-white-supremacists-and-other-extremists,"December 18, 2017, 7:16 PM EST",technology,,"Twitter Inc. pulled some white supremacists and other extremists from its platform on Monday, enforcing new policies to address persistent concerns that it wasn't doing enough combat hate speech and harassment.?Among the accounts that disappeared from the site were those linked to Britain First, the far-right fringe group U.S. President Donald Trump retweeted to near universal condemnation, and white supremacist organizations like the League of the South and American Renaissance.The company's critics described the action as a wide-ranging ""purge,"" noting that it took place on Joseph Stalin's birthday. But prominent extremists continue to have live accounts, including Richard Spencer, the head of the white nationalist group the National Policy Institute; Jason Kessler, the main organizer of last summer's ""Unite the Right"" rally; and David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.Twitter has been criticized for arbitrary decisions on what members and content to ban, and Monday's moves are unlikely to help. ""As of now, I don't see any systematic method to the #TwitterPurge,"" Spencer tweeted, noting he'd lost more than 100 followers but that many ""pro-White"" accounts remained.A rash of vicious personal and racially tinged attacks in recent years led many to conclude that Twitter wasn't serious about policing its service. Ensuing crackdowns on white nationalist accounts fueled arguments on the right that the company unfairly targeted conservative speech. Alternative social media services have emerged in the last year to accommodate people with extreme political views.An increasingly broad swath of Republicans have latched onto the right-wing critique of Twitter. As he pushed forward with an unpopular plan to roll back net neutrality protections this month, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai held Twitter's content moderation policies up as evidence that Silicon Valley companies -- and not big internet service providers -- are the greatest threat to free speech online.Twitter has said it wouldn't take action against government officials, pre-empting calls that Trump is in persistent violation of its rules. But taking down the Britain First accounts targeted the source of one of most intense bouts of controversy over his Twitter use. His retweeting of Britain First accounts led to an outpouring of criticism in the U.K. -- including from Prime Minister Theresa May -- about the promotion of a series of anti-Muslim videos. Though not known outside the U.K., Britain First has a history of inciting violence.The killer of Jo Cox, a lawmaker murdered during the campaign for last year's Brexit referendum, shouted ??Britain First?? as he stabbed and shot her, according to witness testimony at his trial. Lawmakers called for the organization to be banned as a result, but so far authorities have refused.Britain First's leader Paul Golding was arrested in Belfast Oct. 14 while attending the court hearing of his deputy --?Jayda Fransen -- over her use of ??threatening, abusive, insulting words or behavior?? during a rally in August."
Is Alexa Really Eavesdropping on You?,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/is-alexa-really-eavesdropping-on-you-jb25c6vc,"December 11, 2017, 7:00 AM EST",technology,,"I&apos;ve gone all-in on Amazon&apos;s line of Alexa-powered speakers, installing them throughout my home and buying them for family members. We use them to play music and news, tell jokes and get the weather. And I get to talk to a computer like I'm Captain Picard in Star Trek.But stories like this one, in Gizmodo last week, suggest that the popular and inexpensive line of voice-activated speakers pose a threat to user privacy. The writer argues that devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home contain microphones that are ""always on"" and sending volumes of data back to their parent companies. These speakers might also make it possible for hackers and law enforcement authorities to drop a secret wiretap into your living room, the article says.The American Civil Liberties Union agrees, inveighing against ?the Echo and other connected speakers. Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow writes that they ??normalize surveillance.?? Even InfoWars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones got into the act last week, interrogating an Echo on his show with hilarious earnestness. ??Alexa, do you work for the CIA?... Alexa, you are lying to me!... Alexa, who is Jeff Bezos???Now, I don't mean to defend these companies as much as to rationalize my own enthusiasm for these devices. But all these concerns seem a bit overheated. If the companies are telling the truth about how they operate??and lying about it would draw ire from both government regulators and customers??the privacy threat is not as big of a problem as it might appear.First, devices like the Echo and Google Home are not really ??always on.?? They're in passive listening mode, using a small amount of power for something called ??device keyword spotting.?? In effect, the companies say, the device is recording about one second of ambient sound, hunting for the acoustic signature of their wake words, ??Alexa?? or ??OK Google,?? and then constantly overwriting and discarding that fraction of sound.When the wake word is uttered, the Echo glows with a blue crown of light. Only then does it send the command to the cloud and fetch a response from Amazon's servers. Users can look at their personal history in the Alexa smartphone app to see exactly what sound Amazon has sent to its servers. These are typically anodyne commands (??Alexa, play Harry Potter trivia??) or expressions of frustration when the device has misinterpreted a request and is going haywire (??Alexa, STOP!??).The Gizmodo piece acknowledges this but raises some hypothetical scenarios. What if hackers get a hold of the device and change how it operates? This apparently happened once, when a British security researcher had to physically disassemble the device to demonstrate an Echo vulnerability.Then there's the sensational example from earlier in the year when police officials in Bentonville, Arkansas subpoenaed a customer's Alexa records in connection with a 2015 homicide at his home. (Bloomberg's Nico Grant and Aki Ito recorded a great episode of our Decrypted podcast about the case.)Amazon initially fought the subpoena, then acquiesced when the suspect's lawyers agreed that the data could be turned over. They likely realized that the police, like some of Alexa's critics, were overestimating the amount of data Alexa might gather.None of this means we should blindly trust Amazon and Google in other parts of their business, or take our eyes off how these devices evolve. Amazon has talked about handing over customer Alexa transcripts to third party developers. Surely privacy-concerned Echo owners should get a chance to opt out of that program.For now, though, I am going to keep enjoying this new class of devices. And if I'm having a truly sensitive conversation in my dining room? I'll try to stifle the impulse to go outside and whisper.This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology's Fully Charged newsletter.

Mezzo Cotto: Y Combinator President Defends ??Really Bad and Wacky Ideas',https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/mezzo-cotto-y-combinator-president-defends-really-bad-and-wacky-ideas,"December 15, 2017, 7:00 AM EST",technology,,"Silicon Valley is caught in a culture civil war over what to do with bros with unpopular opinions. In an essay titled ??E Pur Si Muove,?? which is Italian for ??And yet it moves,?? Y Combinator President Sam Altman argued Thursday that San Francisco had grown too repressive:??Earlier this year, I noticed something in China that really surprised me. I realized I felt more comfortable discussing controversial ideas in Beijing than in San Francisco. I didn't feel completely comfortable??this was China, after all??just more comfortable than at home.That showed me just how bad things have become, and how much things have changed since I first got started here in 2005.??This thought has been a long time brewing. Altman took over Y Combinator from Paul Graham, the startup essayist who, in what he says?was a long-planned move, stepped back from his role at the firm?around the same time that the people of Twitter were turning against him.When I was a newbie reporter at technology news site the Information, I interviewed Graham for a profile of his wife, Jessica Livingston. During our interview, Graham said the pipeline problem was the real reason that there weren't many female founders??at the time, a fairly mainstream tech industry view. He told me, ??I'm almost certain that we don't discriminate against female founders because I would know from looking at the ones we missed.??Valleywag (R.I.P.) helped really blow up his remarks. Graham's comments about women became a viral topic of conversation. And it may have been a pivotal moment when a powerful Silicon Valley figure's unpopular view actually had a consequence. Valleywag, VentureBeat and other tech industry blogs cited the comments when Graham handed over the reins to Altman a couple months after the controversy.Graham said Friday that the controversy didn't factor into his decision to leave, but it did cause him to rethink his timeline. ??I wouldn't quit YC just because a mob was after me on Twitter over a misquotation. I've had so many mobs after me on Twitter, both before and since that one,?? Graham wrote in an email. ??In fact, the Twitter mob not only wasn't what caused me to leave, but actually caused me to stay longer. I had been planning to announce at the beginning of January (at the beginning of the YC batch) that this would be my last. But the controversy was still going then, and I didn&apos;t want people to think I was leaving because of it, so I delayed the announcement till later.??But Graham's view clearly mattered because he was in a position to recruit more female entrepreneurs. Since he left, Y Combinator has made a real push to recruit women. It's a clear instance where taking someone's opinions seriously had a positive result.I do worry that Graham's virtues??his prowess for identifying promising startup ideas and for crafting koans of startup wisdom??were lost in the shuffle. But they kind of had to be for Y Combinator to feel the public pressure to change. (Willett Advisors, the investment arm for the personal and philanthropic assets of Bloomberg LP founder and majority owner Michael Bloomberg, is an investor in Y Combinator startups.)Altman is also close to Peter Thiel, who supported Donald Trump's run for the presidency and who helped sue Gawker out of existence??another example where someone's opinions are backed up by actions. These opinions matter.There are cases where people have valid unpopular opinions, no matter what the masses think. In fact, Altman lists a few examples, which undercut his main argument: Galileo's views prevailed, even as society came crashing down upon him.

YouTube to Launch New Music Subscription Service in March,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-07/youtube-is-said-to-plan-new-music-subscription-service-for-march,"December 7, 2017, 6:34 PM EST",technology,"""Warner has signed on, talks underway with Sony, Universal"", ""Artists asked to help promote service, internally called Remix""","YouTube plans to introduce a paid music service in March, according to people familiar with the matter, a third attempt by parent company Alphabet Inc. to catch up with rivals Spotify and Apple Inc.The new service could help appease record-industry executives who have pushed for more revenue from YouTube. Warner Music Group,?one of the world's three major record labels, has already signed on,?said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private talks. YouTube is also in talks with the two others, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, and Merlin, a consortium of independent labels, the people said.Paid services from Spotify and Apple Music have spurred a recovery in the music business, which is growing again after almost two decades of decline. Yet major record labels say the growth would be even more significant if not for YouTube, which they criticize for not compensating them enough, considering how much people use the site to listen to tunes. Music is one of the most popular genres of video on YouTube, which attracts more than a billion users a month.YouTube hasn't had the same success as Apple or Spotify in convincing people to sign up for its paid music services, though it's not for lack of trying. Google introduced audio-only streaming service Google Play Music in 2011. YouTube Music Key came along in 2014, giving subscribers ad-free music videos. That morphed into YouTube Red in 2016, letting users watch any video without advertising.The new service, internally referred to as Remix, would include Spotify-like on-demand streaming and would incorporate elements from YouTube, such as video clips, the people said. YouTube has reached out to artists to seek their help in promoting the new service, one of the people said.YouTube must overcome several hurdles to meet a March target. Not only has YouTube been trying to negotiate new deals with Universal and Sony for more than a year, but it also has a talks with Vevo looming early next year. Vevo, owned by Universal and Sony, distributes music videos for their acts.Though the music industry had hoped Red would be devoted to music, YouTube has positioned it as a home for original video projects like science-fiction comedy ??Lazer Team?? and a reboot of ??The Karate Kid.??YouTube hired former Warner Music executive Lyor Cohen last year to help oversee its music operations and serve as a liaison to the record business. Google folded much of the staff for Google Play Music into YouTube earlier this year, and Cohen announced plans to create a new paid service.Google shares rose 0.5 percent to $1049.70 in early New York trading.

FCC Votes to End Net Neutrality Rules,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/net-neutrality-rules-swept-aside-by-republican-led-u-s-fcc,"December 14, 2017, 1:13 PM EST",politics,"""FCC gives up most authority over Comcast, ATT; web practices"", ""Rules revision headed toward likely challenge in federal court""","The U.S. Federal Communications Commission swept aside rules barring broadband providers from favoring the internet traffic of websites willing to pay for speedier service, sending the future of net neutrality on to a likely court challenge.The Republican-led commission voted 3-to-2 on Thursday to remove Obama-era prohibitions on blocking web traffic, slowing it or demanding payment for faster passage via their networks. Over objections from its Democrats, the FCC gave up most authority over broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. and handed enforcement to other agencies.??It is time for us to restore internet freedom,?? said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who was chosen by President Donald Trump to lead the agency, and who dissented when the FCC adopted the rules under Democratic leadership in 2015. ??We are restoring the light-touch framework that has governed the internet for most of its existence.??The change is to occur after the Office of Management and Budget reviews a portion of the rules and ??that can take months,?? Kris Monteith, chief of the FCC's Wireline Bureau, told reporters. The draft order had said the rule change would take effect 60 days after being published in the Federal Register that chronicles regulatory activity.The new rules drew immediate threats of lawsuits seeking to overturn the action. Pai said he's confident of prevailing in court. ??There's no question that what we did was lawful,?? Pai said in a news conference.Read More: Why Trump Wants to Toss Obama's Net Neutrality RulesFree Press, an activist group that helped organize opposition to Pai's order, announced it planned ""to sue the FCC on the basis of its broke process, deeply flawed legal reasoning, willful rejection of evidence that contradicts its preordained conclusions, and absolute disregard for public input.""The attorneys general of Washington and New York states also said they would sue.Eliminating the regulations frees broadband providers to begin charging websites for smooth passage over their networks. Critics said that threatens to pose barriers for smaller companies and startups, which can't afford fees that established web companies may pay to broadband providers, or won't have the heft to brush aside demands for payment. Broadband providers said they have no plans for anti-competitive ??fast lanes,?? since consumers demand unfettered web access.""Today's action does not mark the ??end of the Internet as we know it;' rather it heralds in a new era of light regulation that will benefit consumers,?? David L. Cohen, Comcast's senior executive vice president and chief diversity officer, said in a statement.Earlier: Comcast's Pledge to Behave Without Open-Web Rules Draws DoubtersThe FCC's vote concludes a tumultuous eight-month passage since Pai proposed gutting the earlier rules. The agency took in nearly 24 million comments, but many of those appeared to be of dubious origin including almost half a million routed through Russia.That prompted New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to say he would sue over the ""illegal rollback of net neutrality"" and cited ""two million fake comments that use the stolen identities of people across the country.""Dozens of Democratic lawmakers expressed opposition, while Republicans lauded Pai's plan.Protesters were demonstrating in front of the FCC building as the meeting got underway. Shortly before 1 p.m., just before the vote, a female staff member approached the dais and handed Pai a piece of paper.?Pai adjourned the meeting ""on advice of security"" and armed security guards told attendees to leave bags and coats behind.The meeting resumed about 10 minutes later and the vote was taken.More: Fake Views? 444,938 Russian Emails Are Among Comments to FCCThe reaction in Congress broke down along party lines.The FCC's action will ??return the internet to a consumer-driven marketplace free of innovation-stifling regulations,?? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in remarks prepared before the agency's vote.Two Republican members of the House with responsibility for technology policysaid ""the table is set"" for legislation.The vote ""will help more Americans than ever before access the web, video streaming, telemedicine, and the innovations of the future made possible by increased investment in broadband,"" Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Marsha Blackburn said in a joint statement.""What you're going to see is Congress step forward and take some action to put in place some free and open Internet rules,"" Blackburn told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. ""There are things that we all agree on, like I said??no blocking, no throttling, addressing latency.""Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, said the FCC with its vote ??will put internet service providers, not consumers, in charge of determining the future of the internet.??Pai argued that the Obama-era rules brought needless government intrusion to a thriving sector, and discouraged investment in broadband. Supporters said investment has flowed unhindered, and that rules are needed to keep internet service providers from unfairly exploiting their position as gateways to homes and businesses.Related: Netflix Hits Mute Button in Open-Internet Debate as Vote ArrivesThe FCC with its 2015 rules claimed powers that could include regulating rates charged by internet service providers. The agency said it wouldn't immediately do so, but the prospect helped propel broadband providers' opposition.The cable and telephone companies also criticized the breadth of what critics called utility-style regulations, including a portion written to allow the FCC to vet data-handling practices it couldn't yet envision. Companies supporting Pai's rollback proposal included AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc. and cable providers led by Comcast and Charter Communications Inc.Web companies such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. wanted to keep the previous regulations. ??Having clear, legally sustainable rules in place finally established rules of the road and provided legal certainty,?? the Internet Association, a trade group for web companies, said in comments to the FCC. ??The commission should maintain its existing net neutrality rules and must not weaken their firm legal basis.??Google issued a statement after the vote saying, ""We will work with other net neutrality supporters large and small to promote strong, enforceable protections.""With its vote the FCC rescinded its 2015 decision to treat internet service providers using a portion of the laws designed to regulate utilities. Much of the debate over net neutrality has revolved around this question of classification: whether Washington regulators can wield the kind of intrusive rulemaking that's also used, for instance, to tell telephone providers when and where they can stop offering service.The FCC also abandoned the bulk of its oversight role, saying antitrust authorities and the Federal Trade Commission can monitor for anti-competitive practices. Critics say those agencies don't have expertise and act only after abuses occur, rather than setting rules that guide behavior.In addition, the authority of the FTC is under question in a case before federal judges in California, where AT&T is contesting a sanction from the FTC for deceiving smartphone consumers who paid for unlimited data?only to have their download speeds cut.""We are very disappointed in the FCC action,"" the second-ranking House Democrat, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, said on Bloomberg TV immediately after the vote. ""Access to information on a nondiscriminatory basis is absolutely essential in a democracy. We want to see all information, all users, treated equally.""Opponents of Pai's rules are expected to ask U.S. judges to overturn the ruling and restore the old rules. Issues before the judges will include whether the FCC has adequate grounds to reverse a decision taken less than three years earlier. Judges last year upheld the previous rules.Congress could write a law to overrule the FCC's action, but it hasn't acted as Democrats dismiss Republican invitations to legislate to a permanently weaken the 2015 rules. The Democrats' ??wall of resistance?? may weaken in the new year after partisan fervor heightened by Thursday's vote has a chance to abate, Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant said in a Nov. 21 note. A bill might restore some basic net neutrality protections and also bar the FCC from regulating rates, Gallant said.?? With assistance by Andrew M Harris"

The contract is subject to financing conditions and first payment coming no later than the middle of next year. The deal is the biggest export contract for the Typhoon in a decade, U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said in a separate statement.A Eurofighter Typhoon jetThe order comes at a crucial time for the aerospace manufacturer, which is planning to eliminate more than 2,000 jobs over three years as it struggles to secure contracts for warplanes and slims down its naval ships and cyber-security businesses.?The Typhoon is the cornerstone of a military-aircraft business that employs about 12,500 people at BAE.

Space Startup Raises $90 Million to Start Moon Ads by 2020,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/space-startup-raises-90-million-to-bring-ads-to-moon-by-2020,"December 13, 2017, 4:10 AM EST",technology,"""Startup Ispace targets landing on moon surface by 2020"", ""Goal is to create lunar economy that supports more development""","Japanese companies are planning to kick-start the lunar economy by backing a local startup's mission to land on the moon by 2020.Tokyo-based Ispace Inc. said it raised 10.2 billion yen ($90 million) from some of the country's biggest businesses, including Japan Airlines Co. and television network Tokyo Broadcasting System Holdings Inc. The funds will be used to send a spacecraft into lunar orbit by 2019, and then land one a year later.Private companies are playing a bigger role in space development, from Elon Musk's rocket launcher Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and asteroid miner Planetary Resources Inc., seeking to deliver humanity to the cosmos while securing a return for their shareholders. Ispace says a thriving lunar economy is still decades away, but it is putting profits and corporate projects at the heart of its missions in the coming years.??Human beings aren't heading to the stars to become poor,?? Takeshi Hakamada, chief executive officer of Ispace, said at a press event in Tokyo. ??That's why it's crucial to create an economy in outer space.??Musk voiced support for the latest U.S. effort to return to the moon. ??It is high time that humanity went beyond Earth. Should have a moon base by now,?? he wrote on Twitter.Not all of Ispace's investors are corporations. Government-backed Innovation Network Corp. of Japan is the leading investor in the round with 3.5 billion yen, while Development Bank of Japan also invested an undisclosed amount.Ispace says the initial business opportunity is mostly in marketing, including slapping corporate logos on its spacecrafts and rovers, and delivering images to be used in advertising. A successful landing will also let the company offer what it calls a ""projection mapping service"" -- a small billboard on the moon's surface. The startup says there will be demand from corporations looking to show off their logos with Earth in the background.From 2021, Hakamada plans to land exploration vehicles that will search for water. That in turn can be turned into hydrogen fuel and ultimately perhaps support a lunar settlement.Ispace estimates there are billions of tons of water on the moon, but hard evidence is lacking. In 2009, NASA researchers found molecules associated with water. This year, a study used satellite data to estimate that large amounts of water likely exist under the surface.Ispace got its start through Google's Lunar Xprize, a competition sponsored by Alphabet Inc. that will award $20 million to whoever can land and drive a spacecraft on the moon's surface. Established in 2007 with a target date of 2012 for the first mission, the deadline has been repeatedly pushed back as participants faced technical and financial challenges.Takeshi HakamadaHakamada said Ispace's goals are mostly independent of his efforts with Team Hakuto, his partner in Google's competition. He says both projects will continue, but the funding round will seed development of a sustainable business.Most companies in Google's competition have similar plans, including Cape Canaveral-based startup Moon Express, which counts Chinese gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. among its investors.Japanese companies have a history of fascination with space. In 2014, Otsuka Holdings Co. announced plans to deliver a can of its Pocari Sweat drink to the moon's surface. In 1990, TBS sent a journalist on a Soviet rocket to the Mir space station.??Among Series A funding rounds, this one is the biggest ever for Japan and the biggest globally for a space-related startup,?? Hakamada said."

The Senate bill didn't do either, and that is part of the package set for release, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the details before the bill is unveiled.Separately, House and Senate negotiators agreed to retain Senate language on the treatment of master limited partnerships used by oil, gas and pipeline companies. MLPs are taxed as partnerships but have ownership interests that are traded like stock, allowing projects to attract lower-cost capital. And negotiators would ax the corporate alternative minimum tax, adopting a House provision after coal-mining executives and other corporate leaders balked, according to three people familiar with the talks.Senate?Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said the final compromise bill sticks with the Senate approach he authored.

Blockchain Pumping New Life Into Old-School Companies Like IBM,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-26/blockchain-pumping-new-life-into-old-school-companies-like-ibm,"December 26, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",technology,"""Ledger technology behind bitcoin seen as burgeoning market"", ""Microsoft, Oracle expand cloud services to tap demand""","Blockchain is getting bigger at Big Blue.Demand for the technology, best known for supporting bitcoin, is growing so much that it will be one of the largest users of capacity next year at about 60 data centers that International Business Machines Corp. rents out to other companies around the globe. IBM was one of the first big companies to see blockchain's promise, contributing code to an open-source effort and encouraging startups to try the technology on its cloud for free.That a 106-year-old company like IBM is going all in on blockchain shows just how far the digital ledger has come since its early days underpinning bitcoin drug deals on the dark web.?The market for blockchain-related products and services will reach $7.7 billion in 2022, up from $242 million last year, according to researcher Markets & Markets.?That's creating new opportunities for some of the old warships of the technology world, companies like IBM and Microsoft Corp. that are making the transition to cloud services. And products that had gone out of vogue, such as databases sold by Oracle Corp., are becoming sexy again.??All of these things will get a new life because of blockchain,?? said?Jerry Cuomo, vice president of technology for IBM Blockchain.???Our sales team loves blockchain because a customer that is buying blockchain rarely walks out of the store with just blockchain. They walk out with multiple things in their cart.???Because multiple companies -- such as all parties involved in a supply chain -- can use the same blockchain, it's spurring IBM to revise the way it compensates sales associates. In the past, sales reps got paid when their clients bought IBM technologies directly. Now they will also receive a commission when clients encourage other companies to join them on a blockchain network and use Big Blue's systems and services, Cuomo said.The blockchain enables companies doing business with each other to record transactions securely. Its strength lies in its trustworthiness: It is difficult to reverse or change what's been recorded. The blockchain can also hold many more documents and data than traditional database storage, allowing for more nuanced insights and analysis. It can also hold embedded contracts, such as a lease for a car, whose virtual key could be transferred to a bank in the event of a default.??Blockchain is one of the bright sectors in technology,?? said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. ??Since blockchain infrastructure is fairly beefy, there will be a large pool of revenue associated with sales of equipment, software and related services for blockchain installations.??In addition to hiring third parties for cloud use, companies will rely more on their own databases for storage, said Amit Zavery, senior vice president of Oracle Cloud Platform.???In traditional database systems, there is only one copy of the data for all parties to reference, but blockchain's distributed nature means all of the peers now hold a copy of the data,?? Avery said. ??That will expand the data storage requirements on businesses, especially those in industries with typically high transaction rates.??QuickTake: All about bitcoin, blockchain and their crypto worldIn October, Oracle announced the formation of Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service, which helps customers extend existing applications like enterprise-resource management systems. A month earlier, rival SAP SE said clients in industries like manufacturing and supply chain were testing its cloud service. And on Nov. 20, Microsoft expanded its partnership with consortium R3 to make it easier for financial institutions to deploy blockchains in its Azure cloud.Big Blue, meanwhile, has been one of key companies behind the Hyperledger consortium,?a nonprofit open-source project that aims to create efficient standards for commercial use of blockchain technology. IBM also offers companies a free trial of blockchain in its cloud.Almost six in 10 large corporations are considering using blockchain, according to a Juniper Research survey of 400 executives, managers and tech staff. The technology is increasingly being tested or used by companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Visa Inc. to streamline supply chain, speed up payments and store records.Deployments of blockchain should bump up sales growth in cloud services, databases and servers by 35 percent, according to Susan Eustis, chief executive officer of WinterGreen Research.?Within five years, blockchain technology will push more than 55 percent of large companies with more than 1,000 employees to use the cloud instead of their own data centers, up from 17 percent today, she said.?IBM is selling more messaging systems to deliver transactions into the blockchain, web-interface products and API systems to easier communicate with the chain and web app environments, Cuomo said. Sales of databases could rise as well.??We are seeing a lot of momentum and excitement in this space,?? said Matthew Kerner, partner general manager for blockchain at Microsoft.For more on cryptocurrencies, check out the Decrypted?podcast:"

Most of the gains came since Friday, when the company issued a press release saying it bought Ziddu.com, ??a blockchain-empowered global micro-lending solutions provider?? that transacts only in cryptocurrencies.LongFin joins a growing list of little-known companies that have seen their values soar after simply announcing plans to join the digital currency craze that's pushed the value of bitcoin past $300 billion. The microcap rallies are reminiscent of the height of the dot.com bubble, when virtually any company that put tech in its name found favor on the public markets.For LongFin's Chief Executive Officer Venkat Meenvalli, the rally may be even sweeter. LongFin bought Ziddu.com from its affiliate Meridian Enterprises Pte. for 2.5 million restricted Class A shares. Meridian Enterprises is 95 percent owned by Meenvalli, LongFin said in a regulatory filing Dec. 11.It's not the first time LongFin executives have overseen transactions where they are both the seller and the buyer. Stampede Tradex Pte. Ltd., a subsidiary of Stampede Capital, was sold to Longfin earlier this year.The stock's ride on Monday turned comical around 11:15 a.m., when the first of more than a dozen trading halts hit with the gain at almost 100 percent. It lasted the stipulated five minutes before trading resumed, only to stop again three minutes later. It then started an on-for-one, off-for-five-minute cadence that persisted until noon, when trading ceased for 50 minutes. By that time, the surge had reached 548 percent to $142.82.?The rally is overdone even to LongFin's Meenvalli.??It's crazy, frenzied speculation on the cryptocurrency announcement, which we never expected,?? Meenvalli said in a telephone interview Monday. ??The fundamentals will slowly show, but this is crazy trading and has nothing to do with the company's fundamentals.??When the stock resumed shorty before 1 p.m., the bulge got cut by more than half, to $60. Trading halts resumed, this time for 10 minutes at a time, giving investors scant time to execute trades. The shares closed at $72.38 at 4 p.m., an increase of 229 percent on the day.Volumes also surged. After an average of 241,000 shares changed hands on the first two days, trading averaged almost 12 million in the past two days.?Bloomberg's Camila Russo reports on?the 2,600 percent surge of LongFin shares.LongFin, which offers financing options for small businesses, has financial results going back to 2015, with revenue jumping to $40 million this year from $16 million last year, according to data on its website. The lender reported $7 million of income in the unaudited 2017 results, up from $4 million last year.With the Ziddu.com acquisition, LongFin aims to base some of its services for importers and exporters on the blockchain. It wants to offer micro loans issued in Ziddu coins backed by goods in borrowers' warehouses. Ziddu coins can be converted into bitcoin or ether, which can be converted into dollars, and used for working capital needs, according to the press release. The loans would be paid back in cryptocurrencies, and interest will vary from 12 percent to 48 percent, the statement said.LongFin is one of a growing number of firms that are starting to delve into the cryptocurrency credit market. Some startups are starting to issue loans backed by the borrowers' cryptocurrency holdings, while others help borrowers get financing from third parties.It's too early to tell whether this sector of the cryptocurrency world will catch on and what the consequences will be, but stock investors aren't waiting to find out.??

I&apos;m getting messages from former employees who are trying to figure out the deal. One wrote, ??Uber. Where longterm former employees ask reporters for information about their tenders.??Interested Uber shareholders got an overwhelming packet of information on the deal from NASDAQ Private Market, including Uber&apos;s financials. A few noble employees read me the numbers over the phone.Here are the numbers you should pay attention to mixed in with some useful financial information that Uber has?provided me in the past.2015Gross bookings: $8.9 billionNet revenue: $2.01 billionTotal cost and expenses: $3.33 billionLoss from operations: ($1.33 billion)Net loss: ($2.66 billion)2016Gross bookings: $20 billionNet revenue: $6.45 billionTotal cost and expenses: $9.42 billionLoss from operations: ($3 billion)Net loss: ($319 million)2017 Second QuarterBookings: $8.74 billionNet revenue: $1.66 billionNon-GAAP gross profit: $749 millionPro forma EBIT loss: ($645 million)Adjusted EBIT loss: ($894 million)GAAP loss: ($1.06 billion)2017 Third QuarterBookings: $9.71 billionNet revenue: $2.01 billionNon-GAAP gross profit: $865 millionPro forma EBIT loss: ($743 million)Adjusted EBIT loss: ($1.15 billion)GAAP loss: ($1.46 billion)It&apos;s worth noting that in 2015 and 2016, Uber&apos;s net revenue included the total fare for the carpooling service UberPool, inflating the amount of revenue. Uber has since changed its accounting practice based on revised GAAP rules, and only includes?its share of the revenue from UberPool.OK. What to make of all this? Let&apos;s look at the bull case first. Here&apos;s how Uber has pitched investors over the years: Focus on gross bookings. That&apos;s the figure that reflects the total value of fares paid to drivers. It is a massive number and it keeps doubling.Gross bookings have grown exponentially for years, from $685 million in 2013 to $2.9 billion in 2014 to $8.9 billion in 2015 to $20 billion last year, according to a chart Uber provided in April. Last year, Uber more than doubled at massive scale.Now look at 2017, Uber has said that its first quarter gross bookings were $7.5 billion. Add that to the gross bookings numbers disclosed to investors and we get to $26 billion over nine months this year. Uber&apos;s fourth quarter is traditionally Uber&apos;s best quarter thanks to holiday travel. If Uber&apos;s fourth quarter grew by half as much as it did last year, it would reach $11 billion. That would translate to $37 billion in gross bookings for the year. Uber would come just short of doubling its gross bookings compared to the previous year.(In the summer of 2016, Uber told prospective investors that the company was targeting gross bookings between $38 billion and $42 billion for 2017. So even with a truly terrible, god awful year, the company could just miss its target.)The bull case is also buoyed by signs that Uber can increase?its share of gross bookings, what the company calls its take rate. In the second quarter of this year, Uber&apos;s share of gross bookings came in at 19 percent. In the next quarter, Uber took nearly 21 percent. That increase is good news for Uber&apos;s shareholders and bad news for drivers. Uber has told investors in the past that it thinks that it can sustainably reach a take rate of from?22 percent to 26 percent of gross bookings.HOWEVER, unless you&apos;re Amazon, eventually you have to make a profit. Enter the bear case.Uber had previously disclosed to investors and the press a number it refers to as ""pro forma adjusted EBIT."" That is, its loss?excluding one-time expenses like legal penalties and write-downs. It also excludes interest, taxes and stock-based compensation. According to that way of doing the math, Uber&apos;s loss?was?only $743 million in the third?quarter of this year.I can see why the company likes that number. The question is whether fines, lawsuit settlements and write-downs are unusual or a perpetual feature of Uber&apos;s business model. I&apos;d recommend re-reading my story on Uber&apos;s legal problems.Uber&apos;s true net loss, which the company is disclosing for the first time to investors, is?jarring. Uber lost $1.46 billion in the third quarter. Uber&apos;s loss from continuing operations is on track to significantly surpass the $3.2 billion?achieved in 2016. (One note: Uber&apos;s 2016 loss looks so small because the company?took credit for the sale of its China business to Didi. Look at operating loss if you want to understand the outflows that year.)As worrying as the depths of Uber&apos;s loss, is its?trajectory. Even when you look at the numbers?as Uber likes to count them,?the company&apos;s loss grew by 15 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months. At the end of the first half of this year, Uber had $6.6 billion cash on hand so it won&apos;t run out anytime soon.As gross bookings continue to soar, the question remains whether?Uber will ever be able to make a profit.This story also ran on Bloomberg's technology newsletter Fully Charged.?Sign up here."
Solar Companies Go Door-to-Door in Battle With Tesla,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/knock-knock-solar-companies-battling-tesla-going-door-to-door,"December 18, 2017, 6:00 AM EST",climate-changed,"""Vivint Solar gets 90% of sales from going door-to-door"", ""U.S. rooftop solar contracting after 16 years of growth""","It wasn't a flashy ad or Elon Musk's charm that convinced New Jersey firefighter David Philpott to get solar panels for his home. Instead, it was a neighbor's recommendation and a visit from a?door-to-door salesman.Knocking on doors may seem old-fashioned, better suited for encyclopedia salesmen of decades past than for peddling a high-tech product in the Internet age. In fact, just this year, Musk's Tesla Inc. halted door-to-door solar sales. But other companies remain committed to the traditional ways, notably Vivint Solar Inc., a panel installer that still counts on ringing doorbells for almost 90 percent of its sales.A Vivint Solar foreman installs solar panels at Philpott's home.??It's always been our bread and butter,?? David Bywater,?chief executive officer of the?Lehi, Utah-based company, said in an interview. ??It's a very consultative sale. It's a very large purchase by a consumer.??Finding new sales is a constant issue for residential solar companies, especially now. After 16 years of growth, U.S. demand is contracting and investors have grown impatient with unprofitable companies. Vivint installations have been mostly flat in 2017, while Tesla is adding far fewer systems this year than its SolarCity unit did before it was acquired a year ago. While many early customers were eager to go green, installers are now reviewing their marketing strategies, looking for the best way to reach people who might need more encouragement.That's how it was for Philpott, 55. He'd been curious about going solar. A neighbor had recently installed panels and his daughter had been encouraging greater environmental consciousness. Plus, he'd heard that a no-money-down lease would save him money and he figured solar would make his home more valuable. But all the information he found online was hard to make sense of.??People don't get why there's no cost,?? he said. ??They're skeptical.??So, when Vivint salesman Kevin Powell knocked on the door, Philpott and his wife were already in a pro-solar mindset. Powell had signed up Philpott's neighbor, and after explaining all the details, he signed up Philpott too.David Philpott, left, and David Bywater talk on the front lawn of Philpotts home in Bergenfield, New Jersey.Solar systems aren't a simple sell. They're expensive, there are a lot of regulations and incentives to wade through and customers have to live with the decision for years. That's why an in-home visit can be so important, said Tyson Peschke, an early employee who helped develop Vivint's door-to-door strategy.??Door to door sales will always be a vital part of the solar industry,?? said Peschke, who has since left Vivint and co-founded Blue Raven Solar LLC, an?American Fork, Utah-based rooftop installer.??You have this Silicon Valley idea -- that?you'll go from two users to 10 million overnight with their technology, and with no human interaction whatsoever,?? he said. ??Average Joes won't go in that direction. Solar is an in-home consultation.??While Tesla isn't sending salespeople door-to-door -- it's a luxury brand -- it still does in-home consultations. Tesla on Friday began marketing solar at some of its retail outlets, where customers can also buy its electric cars and home-storage systems. If customers are interested in solar, Tesla will then arrange a site visit.Still, most potential customers still need a home visit. And even if going door-to-door feels outdated, it works.??Investors want to see profitability,?? said Hugh Bromley, a New York-based analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. ??They're willing to see the company invest in marketing so long as it delivers a profit-bearing customer in the very near term.?? Vivint expects to be cash-flow positive next year.There aren't many alternatives to door-to-door sales, according to Peschke.??The problem has been door-to-door sales took off, and no one has come up with the next thing yet,?? he said. ??The big solar companies don't have the resources to reinvent their sales channel.??Rooftop solar companies have developed numerous online tools to help convince people to install panels and generate leads. But this strategy is often more expensive than door-to-door if it requires installers to buy leads of potential new customers.??I believe in door to door,?? Peschke said. ??I believe it will grow. But I hope for the sake of the industry that it will be supplanted by something better.???? With assistance by Chris Martin, and Joe Ryan"

Bank of Japan's $150 Billion ETF Binge Looks Likely to Slow Next Year,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/the-tokyo-whale-s-150-billion-etf-binge-seen-slowing-next-year,"December 10, 2017, 11:00 AM EST",technology,"""BOJ will cut annual target by a third, UBS and Daiwa SB say"", ""Bank currently aims to spend $53 billion a year on ETFs""","As stocks surge and consumer prices inch higher, investors say it's time for the Bank of Japan to reduce equity purchases that have been criticized for distorting the market.Sometime next year, the BOJ will cut its annual buying target for domestic exchange-traded funds by as much as a third from the current 6 trillion yen ($53 billion), says Toru Ibayashi,?head of Japanese equities at UBS Wealth Management in Tokyo. Soichiro Monji of Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. expects a similar reduction, but by the end of March.??Four trillion yen,?? UBS's Ibayashi predicted. ??And everybody will understand.??Conditions have improved drastically since July last year, when the bank virtually doubled its ETF buying goal. Back then, investors were worried about another market downturn following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Now, they're booking profits after Japanese stocks surged to their highest in 26 years, and watching as the economy marks almost a year of mild inflation. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average closed Monday at its highest since 1992.??Fear of deflation was behind the 6 trillion yen target,?? Daiwa SB's Monji said in an interview. ??We're no longer in that kind of environment. Risks are now skewed toward the upside, rather than the downside. It's hard for the central bank to justify its buying spree.??The BOJ started buying ETFs in 2010, with?Governor Haruhiko Kuroda later accelerating purchases as part of an unprecedented stimulus package aimed at revitalizing the economy. The central bank had spent $150 billion on Japanese ETFs as of Dec. 8. It owned 74 percent of the market at the end of October, up from 65 percent a year earlier, according to Investment Trusts Association figures, BOJ disclosures and data compiled by Bloomberg.Everyone from the head of the country's stock exchange to the chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association has questioned the ETF program's size and whether it artificially depresses volatility.The central bank slowed purchases in October, when the Nikkei 225 rose for 16 straight days, its longest run on record. The bank, which tends to buy on days stocks fall in the morning, purchased only 167 billion yen of ETFs that month, well short of its monthly average of 505 billion yen for the year until September.Annual buying doesn't necessarily need to be measured from January to December, BOJ Governor Kuroda said in Nagoya last month, while stressing that the target was for ??about?? 6 trillion yen a year. He sees no immediate need to adjust the pace of buying, he said. The BOJ stepped up purchases in November after equities retreated, buying 598 billion yen of ETFs.Ibayashi of UBS says the global economy has entered a positive cycle, allowing central banks around the globe to rein in massive easing programs. To him, the BOJ should be no exception, as companies are increasing capital spending, which he says will replace stimulus measures.Federal Reserve policy makers are projected to raise the target range for their benchmark interest rate for a third time this year when they meet later this week. The European Central Bank?decided in October to reduce monthly asset purchases by half starting in January.??Given the circumstances at this point in time, it is difficult for the BOJ to keep buying ETFs at six trillion yen per year,???Ibayashi said.Jonathan Garner, chief Asia and emerging markets equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, says the ETF purchases have become ??perhaps the most controversial part?? of the bank's stimulus program. The BOJ's measures include everything from negative interest rates and yield-curve control to buying tens of trillions of yen of bonds each year, on top of its stock purchases.??The current easing program is a bit too much,?? said Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors Japan Co. ??A bullish market presents a window for the BOJ to decrease its purchases.??Naoki Kamiyama, chief strategist for Nikko Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, and Hisao Matsuura, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., say the BOJ won't cut its ETF target anytime soon. For them, the bank is still far from its 2 percent inflation goal, and market distortion is less of a concern. While the BOJ owns about three-quarters of Japanese ETFs, that's less than 4 percent of the stock market.??Why would the BOJ change??? Kamiyama said. ??It would hurt investor confidence and make a pickup in inflation much less likely.??Core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food, rose 0.8 percent in October from a year earlier, still less than half Kuroda's goal, despite the tightest labor market in decades and an economy that's chalked up seven straight quarters of growth.But Ibayashi and Monji say any cutback in ETF buying wouldn't hurt the economy or prices. Spending 4 trillion yen a year is plenty, according to Ibayashi, who expects the bank to promise to step in again when needed if it does lower the target.??We don't have 2 percent inflation yet but we're headed towards it,?? Monji said. ??That's a reason to reduce the scale a bit. There's no need to wait.""?? With assistance by Yuji Nakamura, Abhishek Vishnoi, and Keiko Ujikane"

What it's?actually used for is buying kittens.CryptoKitties, an online game that debuted on Nov. 28, is now the most popular smart contract -- essentially, an application that runs itself -- on ethereum, accounting for 11 percent of all transactions on the network, according to ETH Gas Station. That's up from 4 percent on Dec. 2 for the network, which uses the distributed-ledger technology known as blockchain.The game is actually clogging the ethereum network, leading to slower transaction times for all users of the blockchain, which is a digital ledger for recording transactions.""The pending transactions on the ethereum blockchain have spiked in the last 24 hours, mostly from CryptoKitties traffic,"" Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk, said in an email.CryptoKittiesIn the game, players buy cartoon kittens, and then breed them with other cats. More than 22,000 cats have been sold so far, for a total of $3 million, according to Crypto Kitty Sales. One of the cats went for $117,712, although average sales price hovers around $109, according to the sales tracker. Each cat has a unique identity that's logged on the ethereum blockchain, which is a digital ledger of transactions.Axiom Zen, a company with offices in San Francisco and Vancouver that helps incubate digital startups and new products, created CryptoKitties. ""We wanted to make blockchain technology accessible to the everyday user, as we believe this is a key step in otherwise seeing the technology adopted,"" Bryce Bladon, Axiom Zen's communications manager, said in an emailed response to questions. ""We wanted to explore blockchain applications outside of ICOs and cryptocurrencies.""He also said the company wanted to ""leverage the power of fun and games"" -- hence, the kitties.CryptoKitties is one of the first blockbuster applications to emerge for ethereum. The blockchain is already used for transactions in currency called ether, the second largest after bitcoin. It's also widely used for issuing tokens in so-called initial coin offerings, with which startups raise funds. The game is the first successful non-coin related application to emerge on the blockchain.CryptoKitties' success could be a sign that ethereum may thrive as a gaming platform. Indeed, many users of blockchains are the same kind of people who already play PC and console video games. And it could take a bite out of the $108.9 billion global games market.If the game's popularity continues to skyrocket, it could also potentially increase average transaction prices. Since ethereum's fee structure is affected by demand, costs could go up for everyone.?? With assistance by Jeremy Kahn"

Danish clients will have access before the summer, according the biggest Nordic bank.Nordea is keen to brand itself as the Nordic bank with the boldest technology ambitions.

Brookfield Finds Common Ground With Airbnb in $200 Million Deal,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/brookfield-finds-common-ground-with-airbnb-in-200-million-deal,"December 18, 2017, 12:30 PM EST",technology,"""Landlord invests in rentals with partner of home-sharing site"", ""Joint venture plans to buy up to six communities in Florida""","To expand its portfolio of U.S. apartment properties, Brookfield Property Partners LP is striking an alliance with a company that other landlords are trying to fight.Brookfield plans to invest as much as $200 million in a joint venture with Niido, the multifamily development partner of home-sharing website Airbnb Inc., according to statement Monday. The funds will be used to buy as many as six apartment complexes in Florida and develop them into communities where tenants may rent out their units through Airbnb for almost half the year -- and would share the profits with the landlord.Niido plans to purchase new and under-construction rental properties in cities including Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa, and convert them to home-sharing towers. Brookfield will make an initial investment of $20 million for the first building, a 324-unit property in Kissimmee, near Orlando, the firms said. As an equity investor, Brookfield will share in the 25 percent cut of the revenue from each apartment subleased on Airbnb. New York-based Silverpeak Real Estate Partners is also committing $20 million.??Brookfield is well-positioned to apply its investment capital and experience to help Niido take home-sharing to major cities in the U.S.?? Jonathan Moore, managing director of Brookfield's apartment business, said in the statement.Brookfield and its Toronto-based parent, Brookfield Asset Management Inc., have expanded their apartment holdings in recent years, co-developing Brooklyn waterfront towers and even acquiring a multifamily real estate investment trust. With the Niido deal, the landlord is embracing home-sharing as an essential part of its rental investing strategy, rather than just a nuisance.It's a potentially lucrative proposition. Of all the nights booked last year on Airbnb, 65 percent were in apartment or condo buildings, according to a survey by home-sharing platform Pillow included in a presentation to members of the National Multifamily Housing Council, a landlords group.In a separate survey, the council and Kingsley Associates found that 49 percent of renters under the age of 25 are interested in generating extra income through home-sharing, underscoring the upside to owning properties that are friendly to Airbnb or similar sites.??It certainly gives you a competitive advantage because it's different,?? Cindy Diffenderfer, co-founder of Miami-based Niido, said in an interview. ??You've got a ton of inventory coming to the marketplace, especially in Florida.??Landlords have taken mixed views on how to deal with tenants who profit from leasing out their units. On one end, publicly traded Apartment Investment & Management Co. is suing Airbnb to stop its tenants from subleasing, arguing that tourists are overrunning its pools and gyms. Other owners have given verbal warnings to their renters or terminated leases, according to a survey last year by the National Multifamily Housing Council. Still, 47 percent of landlords said they'd taken no action against renters who have used home-sharing sites.Airbnb, which has been reaching out to apartment owners in hopes of softening their opposition to home-sharing, said Brookfield's investment shows that landlords, developers and Airbnb ??can work together to create value for everyone,?? Jaja Jackson, the San Francisco-based startup's director of global multifamily partnerships, said in a statement.Niido's Kissimmee building expects to begin leasing to tenants in the first quarter of 2018, Diffenderfer said. Tenants there, who will pay market-rate rents estimated at $1,300 a month for a one-bedroom, can then lease out their units for as many as 180 days of their yearlong lease.And there's a system that makes it easy for them to do so. A mobile app allows tenants to manage their calendar of bookings and request housekeeping, linen changes and even fresh flowers to be set up in between guests. Doors will be keyless, meaning entry codes can be changed remotely with every new arrival.The app tracks each tenant's leasing calendar and even suggests rates for nightly rentals, taking into account local festivals and major events that might allow for higher prices, Diffenderfer said.Properties being redeveloped by Niido will be designed to straddle a line between apartment and hotel. There will be fire pits, interactive art installations and a photo booth in the lobby where nightly guests can Instagram their stay. Each community will also have a ??master host?? on site -- someone to offer guests restaurant recommendations or assist when the tenant leasing the apartment is away.Tenants will keep 75 percent of their profits, after local taxes and fees are paid. The landlord will get the other 25 percent.??We've got massive inbound inquires from developers and existing apartment owners,??

Chief Executive Officer John Chen said in an interview. The shares gained as much as 14 percent, to $12. 36 at 9:45 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday increase since Sept. 28.Overall revenue is still declining year over year, but today's BlackBerry looks a lot more like the high-margin software company Chen has been crafting since taking over the company four years ago. Its central software products, which help companies and governments manage and protect their employees' mobile devices, faces steep competition from established companies like International Business Machines Corp. and VMware Inc.After years of firing hardware engineers, BlackBerry's employee base now looks like a software company, with about 1,200 salespeople in the field trying to get new customers to sign up. BlackBerry said Wednesday that the company expects to come in at the top end of its forecast for full-year 2018 revenue of $920 million to $950 million.Total adjusted revenue was $235 million in the fiscal third quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $217.1 million, the company said in a statement. Earnings per share, excluding some costs, were 3 cents, better than the average analyst forecast for break even.Chen is also working to strike new licensing deals for the stable of patents BlackBerry has from its heyday as a smartphone pioneer. Revenue from those deals will be about $100 million annually, but Chen said he intends to increase that going forward."
This Robot Can Mix Drinks in Your Hotel Room,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/this-robot-can-mix-drinks-in-your-hotel-room,"December 18, 2017, 8:00 AM EST",,"""Somabar’s tabletop device replaces the minibar.""","Industrial-size robots have been serving cocktails on cruises since 2014, thanks to Makr Shakr, a company created by MIT professor Carlo Ratti. Now, a tabletop cocktail bot from startup Somabar is headed for restaurants, bars, and lounges and may replace hotel room minibars.?The Benefit: Makr Shakr's robotic arms pull cocktail ingredients selected via touchscreen or app from a network of bottles above the bar. Its creators say the machines can work in places without bartenders, help humans handle busy rush hours, and eventually do more. ??Bartenders will one day be replaced,?? says Somabar Chief Executive Officer Dylan Purcell-Lowe. ??Without a doubt.???Innovator:?? Dylan Purcell-Lowe?? CEO and co-founder of Somabar?? Location: Los Angeles?Augmentation: Purcell-Lowe sees Somabar initially as a tool for busy bartenders and waitstaff, mixing simple cocktails in 5 to 10 seconds so workers can focus on more complex drinks.?Origin: Purcell-Lowe began thinking about automating cocktails while studying political science and business at Occidental College in 2011. He and co-founder Christopher Hameetman raised about $300,000 on Kickstarter in 2015 to develop a consumer robot; Somabar's commercial version now has about $1 million in preorders. The company expects to ship to about 10,000 hotels, restaurants, and bars by the end of 2018.?Challenges: Makr Shakr's industrial robots, which can slice limes as well as mix drinks, require a trailer full of gear and a custom-built bar. (The company says its lease and purchase prices vary according to customer need and location. It plans to launch a smaller, cheaper version next year.) The $2,000 Somabar can only mix drinks and doesn't work with bottles.?The Verdict: A 2013 Oxford study said bartending had a 77 percent chance of being obsolete in the next decade or two. How close are we?Daniel Wilson, a roboticist who authored the best-seller Robopocalypse, says bartenders' jobs will be safe as long as their social skills keep people drinking. Even Purcell-Lowe says fully automated bartending is a ways off. For now, he says, ??we are simply enhancing efficiencies.??"
This $5 Billion Encrypted App Isn't for Sale at Any Price,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/cryptic-russian-crusader-says-his-5-billion-app-can-t-be-bought,"December 11, 2017, 9:00 PM EST",technology,"""Pavel Durov and his encypted messenger set up shop in Dubai"", ""Telegram founder left Russia with $300 million, 2,000 bitcoins""","Even half-naked on Tinder, where he just popped up, Pavel Durov loves to play hard to get.??Not looking for anything serious or not serious here,?? the Russian privacy crusader warns potential dates in Dubai, where he's finally trying to settle down after roaming the globe for three years. ??Just playing with the app.??Durov, 33, has been toying with technology a lot since he was forced to sell his remaining stake in Russia's largest social network, VK, to a Kremlin-friendly billionaire in 2014. The encrypted messenger he's been working on, Telegram, which he calls hack-proof, already has about 180 million users, including 40 million in Iran alone, and is luring half a million more each day.He and his older brother Nikolai, an award-winning mathematician and programmer, fine-tuned their software while moving from country to country, avoiding recruiters from spy and law-enforcement agencies like the FBI, which he says tried to bribe one of his developers in San Francisco. The locations of his servers are a secret, as are many of the names of his employees, several of whom he's said are fellow millionaires.??I love it here,?? Durov says over seafood paella at the Siddharta Lounge overlooking the marina, not far from his new office on the 23rd floor of a skyscraper in Dubai Media City.???It's developing so fast, like a start-up.??Clad in black t-shirt and jeans, the St. Petersburg native said he's planning to announce ??something big?? in the new year. Having left his homeland with an estimated $300 million from the VK sale and 2,000 bitcoins, he's been keeping a low profile until now, and for good reasons.For starters, he has at least tangential ties to two of the most influential antagonists of the U.S. government:?Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. The Wikileaks founder has endorsed Telegram's encryption technology, while Durov offered the NSA whistleblower a job after he landed in Moscow in 2013.?And then there's Iran, which recently charged Durov in absentia with crimes related to Telegram's popularity among terrorists, human traffickers and pedophiles. Durov seems unfazed by?the pressure, even from a country?that still urges the murder of a novelist over a book written three decades ago.??I'm motivated by curiosity,?? he said. ??It's super-interesting to see what it's like to run the most popular social media platform in a country like Iran.??With Twitter and Facebook banned, Telegram accounts for about 40 percent of all Iranian internet traffic, according to Techrasa, a market researcher. And that's after local wireless carriers convinced officials to ban the encrypted voice-call function Durov rolled out in April. Telegram, which is open-sourced and works on both phones and PCs, hosts 500,000 Farsi ??channels?? where users can post and curate all kinds of content that others can monitor for free.Telegram doesn't require users to know each other's phone numbers to communicate, just a screen name. Thousands of people using different operating systems can have their own secure chat and share a wide range of attachments, which is one reason the app emerged as a tool of Islamic State jihadists. Durov said he's developing a search function that will help weed out extremist content, but private data will always be ??off limits.??Another thing the Durov considers out of bounds is profit. He sees Telegram as a charity that he'll start to monetize early next year, but only enough to fund expansion. And unlike his earlier creation, VK, which will face political pressure from the Kremlin as long as it's based in Russia, he said Telegram can't be bought -- at any price.While the founders of bigger rivals like WhatsApp and Skype eventually cashed out, Durov said he'll continue to reject buy-in offers like those he's received from some of Silicon Valley's biggest names. He won't identify them, but he put their valuations of Telegram in the $3 billion to $5 billion range.??Even for $20 billion, it's not for sale,"" he said. ??That's a lifetime guarantee.??When Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014, it paid about $40 per user, which could provide a useful benchmark to value Telegram, according to Alexander Vengranovich, a tech analyst at Otkritie Capital in Moscow. But that's not a perfect comparison because Telegram is becoming more of a social-media platform, since the messenger market is already pretty saturated, he said.As far as fortunes go, there's little indication that Durov has risked much of his on anything other than a few strategic acquisitions. He said he paid $750 apiece for his bitcoins about four years ago, a holding that's surged in value from $1.5 million to more than $35 million. He also invested enough in St. Kitts and Nevis to become a citizen of that Caribbean nation.The internet tycoon said he's optimistic about bitcoin because it's ??digital gold.?? Running one of the world's most popular messaging apps, he said, is particularly stimulating when something ??completely unpredictable?? happens -- ??like right now, the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency community just switched to Telegram.??Durov said he chose Dubai in part for is its tax-free zone, which appeals as much to his laissez-faire philosophy as it does to his bottom line.??It's a matter of principle,?? he said. ??A lot of people in the western world don't realize how much taxes limit their options. You can end up paying almost half your income in taxes, which basically means you're working for the government for 180 days a year. I think I can find better ways to use the money I make for the benefit of society.??But there's a flip side to living in a country as socially and religiously conservative as the United Arab Emirates, as Durov admits.??If I were gay, for example, it would be a little more difficult for me,?? he said. ??Or if I needed to drink alcohol all the time -- or eat pork.??He's a man of contradictions, posting a photo of himself bare-chested on Tinder and then refusing to be photographed for this story, inviting reporters to his new office, only to change his mind.Durov was born both in the Soviet Union and in 1984, two factual and fictional symbols of the evils of the surveillance state. He became a hero to many Russian millennials when he trolled the FSB for demanding VK user data in 2011, after opposition leaders used the network to organize the biggest protests of Vladimir Putin's now-18-year rule.He responded to the KGB successor by posting a photo of a tongue-wagging German Shepherd wearing a hoodie on his popular Twitter feed. But Durov, who wasn't even old enough to vote when Putin first came to power, avoids talking politics, including the U.S. election hacks. He said he had no idea if Russia was behind the phishing attacks on the Democrats, but whoever was certainly didn't need a state sponsor.??I could have done that when I was 12,?? he said. ??It's not hard.??What is fair game for criticism, though, are policies like the ??insane, stupid laws?? that give Russia's government more spying powers, he said. Even so, the last thing Durov wants is to be viewed as a dissident.In fact, there's a crowning irony Durov delights in: One of the most secretive tribes on the planet, Putin's staff in the Kremlin, not only uses his encryption network, but praises it publicly, albeit with a characteristic caveat.??Telegram is very handy,?? Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said?via Telegram.???We're using it for public information, but not for non-public information. The internet can never be totally secure anywhere.????

The agreement addresses union concerns about the company's plan to pay 1.5 times normal hourly rates to pilots willing to pick up flights in need of crews, according to a statement on the union website.?The plan should calm travelers' fears about their holiday flights. While American said Thursday that it had covered all but a few hundred trips, the union said its count early Friday showed thousands of flights scheduled for the last two weeks of the month were still missing one or both pilots. American will make about 200,000 flights in December.A processing error in American's scheduling system Nov. 24 wrongly showed the carrier had ample staffing coverage for some flights when it actually didn't. The system let pilots drop trips they had already been assigned this month even though there were no other aviators available to staff them.The mistake affected both domestic and international flights from cities including Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami, New York, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C. As part of the Friday agreement, the union withdrew a grievance it had filed against the carrier."

Gaies was in Audible's San Francisco office as recently as last week presenting product plans to his team, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified.Katz told employees in an email last month that Audible was conducting an internal investigation into workplace culture after a survey found that ??some employees feel that Audible is less of a safe space for women than it has been intended to be since founding.?? Katz urged employees to come forward with any information about inappropriate behavior and said Audible had hired a third party to conduct confidential interviews, according to the emails reviewed by Bloomberg.??We will aggressively and appropriately pursue specific incidences that may surface in the process,?? Katz promised at the time.In a subsequent email dated Nov. 20, Katz said the investigation was still under way and urged staffers to speak up. He also stressed that Audible would take action to provide more training to prevent discrimination, harassment and unconscious bias and said the company would consider revising its code of conduct.An Audible spokesman declined to comment on the reasons Gaies and Lopes left because the company doesn't disclose details of personnel matters. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on any possible connection between the investigation and the departures. Attempts to reach Gaies and Lopes through social media platforms were unsuccessful.Audible was purchased by Amazon in 2008. The Newark, New Jersey, based-company records well-known book titles and produces exclusive radio-style shows and podcasts for a subscription. Entertainment plays a crucial role in Amazon's effort to reach consumers beyond its core business of selling sneakers, electronics and laundry detergent.?Lopes had worked at Audible since 1999, becoming chief revenue officer in February 2016, according to his LinkedIn biography. Gaies joined Audible in 2012 after three years as a senior corporate counsel for Amazon, according to his LinkedIn biography.Amazon suspended Roy Price, the head of its film and TV unit, in October after a producer told the Hollywood Reporter he sexually harassed her. Price later resigned."

He said in court last month that his lawyer drafted the document?and that he couldn't stand by certain allegations, including ones pertaining to the theft of Alphabet's self-driving car information at Waymo, which are at the center of the case. Uber paid Jacobs $4.5 million to work as a consultant following the company's receipt of the letter and gave his lawyer $3 million. The company later derided Jacobs as an ??extortionist???who made ??fantastical???claims for money.Uber?wrote in an emailed statement Friday: ??While we haven't substantiated all the claims in this letter??and, importantly, any related to Waymo??our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology.??While Jacobs's credibility has been called into question, Uber has acknowledged that at least one of the main allegations in the letter is true.?Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi?said last month that encrypted messaging apps were ??used often?? and that he instructed employees in late September to stop using them to discuss business.

The deal can be completed in 12 to 18 months if regulators approve it, Disney said.??Disney is becoming the Walmart of Hollywood: huge and dominant,?? said Barton Crockett, a media analyst at B. Riley FBR. ??That's going to have a big influence up and down the supply chain.??This is the first major consolidation in Hollywood since?Comcast Corp. swallowed Universal Pictures in 2011. With Fox and Disney under one corporate roof, the top six studios will shrink to five.?Comcast, which bought DreamWorks Animation last year, may feel it must buy another studio to stay competitive. Meanwhile, smaller independent studios, like Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, or larger entities such as Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures, could face more pressure to sell.Getting bigger would give studios more content and intellectual property, while cutting costs, helping them create movies that dominate the weekend box office, Crockett said.Fox would give Disney even more leverage in negotiations with theater chains, like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., which have been undergoing their own wave of consolidation. Disney asked some theaters for a greater share of ticket sales for big films like ??Star Wars,?? according to a person familiar with the situation. Usually the revenue is evenly split but on very popular films, Disney can claim more than 60 percent.Disney could try the same tactic again with Fox's popular film franchises like ??Avatar,?? which has four big-budget sequels in the works.?Disney and Fox combined for 40 percent of ticket sales in 2016 in the U.S and Canada, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.??We would expect Disney's increased scale to be a meaningful negative to exhibitors,?? Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, wrote in a note Wednesday. AMC shares are down more than 50 percent so far this year.A Disney-Fox tie-up would follow years of growing concentration at the box office, with most ticket sales going to a smaller number of movies. Last year, the top 10 films accounted for 34 percent of the total, up from a historical average of about 28 percent, according to Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Co.One looming question is whether Disney will distribute any movies under the Fox label, or increase its output at all. So far, Disney's strategy has been to narrow the number and type of movies it makes to focus on big-budget, family-friendly franchises. Fox has put out 22 flicks so far this year. Disney has distributed just seven, yet still may end the year with the highest box-office sales of any studio with the latest ??Star Wars?? opening this week.Disney could scale back the slate of indie dramas at Fox's Searchlight studio in favor of even more blockbusters with sequels, merchandise and theme park attractions. That could leave less room at theaters for ??smaller specialty stuff?? and independent players like A24, which distributes Oscar-winning films such as ??Moonlight,?? Crockett said.Owning Fox will also help Disney's TV production. Fox has one of the largest TV studios, and a stake in Endemol Shine, maker of reality shows like ??MasterChef?? and ??Deal or No Deal.?? A larger slate of popular reality programming could allow Disney to license shows around the world, a profitable strategy that Warner Bros. has used with ??The Bachelor.???To be sure, the ripple effect of a Disney-Fox combination in Hollywood will be muted somewhat by the recent arrival of Silicon Valley giants. Merging Disney and Fox would create one less buyer for movie and TV show ideas and almost certainly lead to job cuts. A few weeks after completing its acquisition of DreamWorks last year, Comcast cut about 200 jobs there.?Tech companies like Netflix Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. could fill the void by buying more TV and movie scripts, and some job losses at Disney and Fox could be absorbed by these new entrants.Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger is preparing to introduce the company's own streaming-video services in the next couple of years. Disney movies that are now available on Netflix will be pulled off the service so Iger's company can offer them exclusively online. In an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Television, Iger said he'll probably do the same with Fox programming that's now available on HBO and Netflix.??They have a relationship with Netflix and HBO, but we will be looking at more direct-to-consumer opportunities for our company,?? Iger said. Disney's purchase of Fox leaves unclear the futures of Fox film studio chief?Stacey Snider and?Dana Walden and Gary Newman, co-chairmen of Fox Television Group, since Disney already has a successful studio chairman in Alan Horn, and Ben Sherwood leads Disney's ABC Television Group.Amid the distraction of an impending deal, Fox studio employees have been soldiering on. Late Wednesday, senior members of the 20th Century Fox film team were making their way to the East Coast for the red-carpet premiere of the movie ??The Post,?? a continent away from the merger brewing in L.A."

Cboe Global Markets Inc. debuts the first bitcoin-futures product on Sunday, while CME Group Inc., the world's largest exchange owner, will start offering a similar product by the end of the year.Clients' views are polarized between those that see the new products as bitcoin's route into the mainstream of financial markets, and those who believe it's a bubble waiting to burst, said Heiko Geiger, executive director at Vontobel in Frankfurt. Bitcoin touched a record high of more than $17,000 on Friday, having surged about 1,500 percent this year.??Views are very clear cut,?? Geiger said. ??Some investors expect more liquidity in the market through the introduction of the future contracts while others are preparing to short crypto. Overall, clients are bullish.??Switzerland is establishing itself as something of a digital-currency hub. The Ethereum Foundation, which is behind the second-biggest cryptocurrency, is incorporated in the country, while the city of Zug last year piloted a project where users of government services were able to pay in bitcoin.Vontobel offers what it calls participation certificates, a kind of derivative that allows bets for or against the digital currency, while Falcon offers direct investment in bitcoin.Already there's ??a lot of turnover?? in Vontobel's bitcoin products, Geiger said.The entry of Cboe and CME's futures is widely seen as a game-changer for the industry because many professional investors have been unwilling to do business on the unregulated platforms where bitcoin currently trades.

Ocado Hit by Driver Shortage in Brexit-Squeezed Labor Market,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/online-grocer-ocado-s-sales-growth-hurt-by-shortage-of-drivers,"December 14, 2017, 2:47 AM EST",business,"""U.K. labor market has tightened as Brexit reduces EU migration"", ""Company's 11.6% sales growth allays fears of major slowdown""","Ocado Group Plc is struggling to find drivers to deliver Britons their groceries as Brexit puts a further squeeze on the U.K.'s?tightest labor market on record.The online grocer on Thursday reported a slowdown in sales growth, saying it was held back by a shortage of drivers. Investors took relief from that explanation amid fears that growth in the U.K.'s online grocery market had tailed off significantly. Ocado's shares rose as much as 4.9 percent in London, reversing an early decline.??There is tightness in the labor market, particularly in the southeast of England,?? the area around London, Ocado Chief Financial Officer Duncan Tatton-Brown said by phone. ??In certain locations we have found it more difficult to hire drivers.??The shortage comes amid a plunge in the number of migrant workers arriving in the U.K. from the European Union as the country prepares to leave the bloc. That has made it more difficult for Britain's shop owners to find the temporary workers they need during the holiday season, driving up wages for some retail jobs.Ocado's not the only company citing shortages. Diageo Plc is concerned that U.K. retailers will lack workers to sell the company's gins and whiskies as the available labor pool shrinks on fewer arrivals from the EU, the distiller's corporate relations director, Dan Mobley, said in a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday.??Brexit now makes imperative that bigger companies and smaller companies start to upskill younger British people, unemployed British people,?? Mobley said.EU nationals make up two-thirds of the permanent workforce in the U.K.'s food and drink supply chains, according to the British Retail Consortium. Tesco Plc Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis has warned that agricultural labor shortages are among the biggest Brexit-related risks facing the U.K.'s largest retailer.Ocado's gross retail sales growth slowed by 2.7 percentage points to 11.6 percent for the quarter ended Dec. 3.The company declined to cite Brexit as a reason for the driver shortage and said the problem has largely been resolved for now. In some locations the company increased wages to attract more candidates, Tatton-Brown said.That explanation came as a relief to some Ocado investors after data from researcher Kantar Worldpanel this week showed that growth in the U.K.'s online grocery market had slowed significantly to 2.8 percent over the last 12 weeks. The company's growth is ??reassuring?? in light of downbeat market expectations, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Francois Halconruy.Ocado last month announced a landmark technology licensing deal with French supermarket operator Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA, its first major client outside the U.K. Tatton-Brown said he's confident Ocado will be able to sign more agreements in the medium term and that the company is focusing its efforts on striking new deals in developed European markets and North America.??

Even so, the new market is so explosive that Israel must set controls, he said. ??The quest for investments in bitcoin reminds me of the 19th century gold rush.??Public interest in digital assets has exploded this year, spurred by technology innovation and diminished trust in governments and central banks after the financial crisis. As bitcoin soared above $11,000 from its 2016 close of $952, the largely unregulated trading has drawn increasing calls for rules to protect investors and safeguard governments from losing tax revenue.Yet many countries remain divided on whether or when to develop cryptocurrency policy. In the Philippines, the central bank's Governor Nestor Espenilla said it's in talks with the nation's Securities and Exchange Commission on ways to oversee ICOs, in which companies raise funds through the sale of digital tokens.In the U.K., according to the Telegraph newspaper, ministers are launching a crackdown on virtual currencies amid growing concern it is being used to launder money and dodge tax. And in Israel, there was some skepticism about Hauser's ideas.??The vision of Israel becoming an international hub is wishful thinking that stems from Israel's technology abilities,?? said Yaniv Pagot, chief investment strategist at the Ayalon Group, an institutional investor. ??I don't think there are enough people in Israel ready to give a kosher stamp for something like this yet.??In his comments, Hauser was referring to the rapid influx of fortune seekers to sites of newly discovered gold deposits in the western U.S., Australia and Canada in the 1800s. While blockchain is a legitimate technology that should be adopted to cut costs to investors, bitcoin is a means of digital payment that appears to have ??gotten out of control,?? said Hauser, who will be leaving the post early next year. His speech was sent to journalists by email.Israel has yet to set a cohesive policy for cryptocurrencies. The Israel Tax Authority has deemed bitcoin a taxable financial asset, and the central bank has warned the public about risks associated with investing the commodity."

The move follows similar efforts by New York and Illinois and comes amid pressure from?Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., which?owns and operates the reactors in New Jersey.???It's another shoe dropping,?? said Kit Konolige, a New York-based analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. ??If there's the political will to do this, it will get done.??Nuclear reactors, which struggle to compete with low natural gas prices, offer a singular advantage in the fight against global warming because they produce round-the-clock electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. The debate over bailing them out has reached the national stage, with Energy Secretary Rick Perry calling for reactors to be rewarded, alongside coal plants, for their ability to stockpile fuel on site. Critics argue the move would undermine competitive markets.The New Jersey legislation, whose sponsors include?Democratic state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, calls for awarding credits to financially strapped nuclear plants that don't qualify for other assistance. Electric utilities would be required to buy those credits and pass the cost onto customers.The projected annual cost of $320 million would break down to about $40.80 per household, said Stefanie Brand, New Jersey's ratepayer advocate.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whose term expires next month, indicated support earlier this month for a bill to help keep the state's reactors running.??It's important for our energy security,?? Christie said at a Dec. 6 news conference in Trenton. ??And I think it's a positive thing from an environmental perspective.??PSEG welcomed the proposal for a ??nuclear safety net.????The same financial pressures that have forced other nuclear plants around the country to close are knocking on New Jersey's door,?? the utility said in a statement Friday.Last year, New York became the first state to offer a lifeline to nuclear plants.

Bae said. ??But then I realized, oh, it actually works.??It's certainly worked, at least so far, for those who got in early and rode the speculative wave that pushed the cryptocurrency above $14,000 on Thursday. But where bitcoin and its ilk go from here is the subject of fierce debate, nowhere more so than in Korea, which has emerged as a sort of ground zero for the global crypto-mania.Roger Ver, chief executive officer at Bitcoin.com, discusses the powerful innovation of cryptocurrencies.So many Koreans have embraced bitcoin that the prime minister recently warned that cryptocurrencies might corrupt the nation's youth. The craze has spread so far that, in Korea, bitcoin is trading at a premium of about 23 percent over prevailing international rates.While neighboring Japan hosts more transactions?by some measures, Korea punches far above its weight: In the 24-hour period through Wednesday evening in Seoul, about 21 percent of the world's bitcoin trades on fee-charging venues involved the Korean won, according to Coinmarketcap.com. The country accounts for about 1.9 percent of the global economy.Read more: All About Bitcoin, Blockchain and Their Crypto WorldAs Korean policy makers grow increasingly worried that the mania has gone too far, the nation could become a focus for bitcoin traders around the world. Korea's top financial watchdog, which briefly roiled cryptocurrency markets with its ban on initial coin offerings in September, said this week that it has ??grave concerns?? about overheated speculation and has formed a task force with other government bodies to increase supervision.??Given the size of the market, there's a greater need for them to come up with something soon,?? said Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd.There's no definitive explanation for why bitcoin has grown so popular in Korea, but local analysts point to a mix of geopolitical and cultural factors.Bitcoin's stateless status appeals to some Koreans who've grown wary of keeping their savings in a country that shares a border with Kim Jong Un's increasingly belligerent regime in North Korea, according to Kwak Keumjoo, professor of psychology at Seoul National University.Political turmoil at home may also be adding to the cryptocurrency's appeal, she said. President Park Geun-hye was ousted in March after an influence-peddling scandal that involved the nation's biggest companies.??People want to take comfort in something outside and beyond the country,?? Kwak said.Korea's individual investors have long had an affinity for supercharged financial wagers, notes Tai-ki Lee, senior research fellow at the Korea Institute of Finance.Equity derivatives are wildly popular in the country, in part because they allow investors to make leveraged bets. Korea's market for stock-index options was the most active worldwide by number of contracts until the government began cracking down on speculation in 2011, according to the Futures Industry Association.Kim Do-young, a 34-year-old audio producer in Seoul, said he was drawn to bitcoin because opening an account was easy and it looked like a chance to make a fast buck. ??You can cash out super quickly,?? he said.Kim adds to his holdings of bitcoin and about 20 other cryptocurrencies every week, taking profit when he needs money to pay rent.While it's unclear what measures will emerge from Korea's cryptocurrency task force, the government seems intent on acting. The tax authority is considering a levy on cryptocurrency trading gains, Yonhap News reported on Tuesday, while Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon warned last month that cryptocurrencies could become gateways to pyramid schemes and other illicit activity if left unchecked.??If we let things continue, I feel some serious pathological phenomena could occur,?? Lee said.Bae, who bought his first bitcoin in November 2016 to pay a ransom to hackers who had hijacked his computer, sees room for the market to take a breather as regulators clamp down and arbitragers target the local price premium. He sold most of his holdings on Nov. 29.But he's prepared to jump back in once prices fall. After devouring books and articles about bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology, Bae is convinced cryptocurrencies will come to be viewed as a store of value by more and more people around the world.As for the regulatory risk, he takes comfort from the fact that bitcoin shrugged off China's crackdown on ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges earlier this year.??Now I only have one bitcoin,?? said Bae, who checks the market price about 10 times a day. ??But I'll be buying again for sure.????

Delta, which dominates service at the airport, reported 400 scrubbed flights on Monday. Southwest Airlines Co. said it was operating its full schedule after scrapping 70 flights Sunday.While most power was restored around midnight, some operations had yet to return fully as of 9:30 a.m. The SkyTrain connecting the airport with an off-site rental car facility and the underground Plane Train linking concourses were both expected to begin running again around 10 a.m., airport spokesman Reese McCranie said.Passengers at Hartsfield-Jackson International AirportThe local utility in charge of the electricity supply, Georgia Power Co., said a fire caused ??extensive damage?? in an underground facility, though no passengers or workers were in any danger.Atlanta Mayor?Kasim Reed said the blaze's intensity damaged the switch that would have allowed the built-in backup power systems to take over. Heat and fumes in underground tunnels complicated matters further by preventing Georgia Power crews from starting work on repairs for some time and lengthened the disruption, he said at a Sunday night news conference.There is ??no evidence to suggest the fire was caused deliberately,?? Reed said.The backup system's failure to take over didn't surprise Bob Edwards, a former chief information officer at United Continental Holdings Inc., who witnessed a similar shutdown in Houston about 15 years ago.?Every airport will have redundancy, ??but in almost every case there's some point in your solution where you've got a single point of failure,?? he said.A massive failure at Delta's Atlanta computer center in the summer of 2016 and a round of storms in April each sidelined thousands flights, costing the airline $150 million and $125 million, respectively.

Aircraft were held at their departure airports and planes in the air were diverted to other cities, the airport said.At one point, Delta had almost 100 planes that were unable to park at gates because of the power power failure, an airline spokesman said.

Uber said in a statement. ??However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours. As our new CEO has said, it is appropriate to regulate services such as Uber. We want to partner with cities to ensure everyone can get a reliable ride at the tap of a button.??The question of whether Uber is a transport service has long vexed regulators and lawmakers across Europe. Uber has faced roadblocks, real and regulatory, in the region, amid complaints brought by taxi drivers who say the company tries to unfairly avoid regulations that bind established competitors.Start ups argue that their apps offer flexible hours to workers. Regulators, governments and unions allege that companies are profiting on the backs of people without benefits such as overtime pay or vacation time.Without the pressure from regulators, companies in the gig economy will force rivals to employ similarly aggressive tactics, said Andrew Taylor,?who earlier this year was commissioned by U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to come up with recommendations to regulate the new business types.""There's a danger of a race to the bottom,""?Taylor said. ""Major American companies are treating national norms, culture, regulators and tax systems in a cavalier way.""Mark Graham, professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, said the scrutiny represents a shift against companies that have avoided regulations facing more traditional businesses in the markets they are trying to disrupt by classifying themselves as technology platforms.Uber isn't the only business model being questioned by policymakers. In Paris, regulators are clamping down on Airbnb, whose home-rental service has drawn complaints from hotels that are subject to a different batch of rules. Deliveroo, the food-delivery service, is also facing scrutiny over its treatment of workers in the U.K. and elsewhere.?The EU court's decisions in this and a pending case may bring clarity for Uber's continuing battles in national courts. London has become a lighting rod for all of the company's problems. The car-service provider is fighting regulators and drivers in court as it tries to protect its hold on its busiest market outside of the US.?London's transport regulator banned Uber in September, citing safety concerns, and an appeal will be heard as soon as April. Two drivers successfully sued the company over vacation and overtime in a suit that would force Uber to radically change the way it treats its drivers.The case is: C-434/15, Asociacion Profesional Elite Taxi.??

Ford Now Plans to Move Production of Electric SUVs From Michigan to Mexico,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-07/ford-moving-production-of-electric-suv-from-michigan-to-mexico,"December 7, 2017, 9:56 AM EST",business,"""Shift makes room for more autonomous car output at U.S. plant"", ""Moving EV manufacturing south of border risks Trump's ire""","Ford Motor Co. is changing gears again in Mexico, shifting planned production of a small electric-powered sport utility vehicle to a plant south of the border instead of a Michigan factory.Sending the electric vehicle to Mexico, where labor costs are lower, will help the business case for the costly model. It also risks raising the ire of President Donald Trump, who had been sharply critical of an earlier plan by Ford to build a small car factory in Mexico that the company ultimately canceled.??They have to do what's best financially and this electric vehicle is not going to be huge?? in terms of sales volume, said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with car-shopping website Autotrader. ??It's not like they're not putting money into the U.S.??Moving production of the as-yet-unnamed electric SUV to Mexico will allow the carmaker to boost planned output of self-driving vehicles at its factory in Flat Rock, Michigan. Ford is boosting its investment by $200 million and adding 150 more jobs to the Michigan plant as part of the shift, Jim Farley, Ford's executive vice president of global markets, said in an interview. The driverless car is to debut in 2021.The SUV to be built in Mexico starting in 2020 will go 300 miles on a single charge and is the centerpiece of a planned $4.5 billion overhaul of Ford's lineup?to add 13 electric or hybrid models, including a gas-electric F-150. Ford has been viewed by Wall Street as playing catch-up to rivals such as Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co., which already sells the battery-powered Chevy Bolt and plans to introduce robot taxis in 2019.??Our ambition for electrification is not modest,?? Farley said. ??We're going for it. We think electrification is a significant shift in propulsion for our industry.??Ford's chief executive officer, Jim Hackett, has been accelerating the automaker's moves in electric and autonomous cars, while announcing $14 billion in cost cuts to improve what he calls the company's ??fitness.?? After replacing Mark Fields as CEO in May, one of Hackett's first moves was to shift a plan to make the Focus small car in Mexico to one of the automaker's plants in China.Trump did not tweet his displeasure this summer with Hackett's plan to build small cars in China to be exported to the U.S., nor has he blasted the automaker after news broke Wednesday of the electric SUV's shift to Mexico.Related: Ford's?iPhone-Inspired Gamble: Chinese Cars Will Sell in America??Automakers have been out of the line of fire of late with so many other issues brewing in D.C.,?? Krebs said, adding that the impact of the president's planned changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement represents an ??unknown?? for Ford as it shifts the electric SUV to Mexico.Farley said it is too early to tell how possible changes to NAFTA could affect Ford's Mexican output, but he said the automaker couldn't wait to make a decision on where to build the electric SUV because it goes into production in just over two years. He characterized Ford's move as ??first and foremost an announcement of incremental investment in America.????Our growing ambitions in autonomous vehicles really means we don't have room?? for the electric vehicle at the Flat Rock factory, Farley said. ??We had to come up with a different manufacturing strategy for our EV.??The Wall Street Journal reported the automaker's change of plans earlier.The self-driving car Ford will build in Michigan will be a vehicle specifically designed for ride-hailing and delivery services, Farley said and described in a Medium post Wednesday. The automaker will begin testing the car in an unnamed big city next year, Farley said.??We're going to go and start to test our business model in a city next year,?? Farley said, citing the company's recent partnership with Lyft. ??We're not just going to be testing autonomous vehicle miles.

Ride-hailing is a controversial topic and last year central Jakarta was brought to a standstill by thousands of taxi drivers angry over the spread of ride-sharing applications.According to Purnomo, it's important for the government to step in to regulate the burgeoning ride-hailing industry to keep customers safe and ensure there's a level playing field.??When another business model comes, really unregulated on safety issues, pricing issues and tax issues, for example, then it is not a level playing field,?? she said. ??As long as there are clear regulations, then we will adapt and adhere to the regulations.??The company said in July it expects revenue this year to increase after the Indonesian government stepped in to regulate tariffs for ride-hailing apps. Beyond passenger transportation, Blue Bird is also looking to expand its logistics business, according to Purnomo, and is seeking partners to do expedite that.??Because of the economic growth in Indonesia and the high logistics costs in Indonesia at this moment - 24 percent of GDP; that's extremely high - the opportunity for logistics is still big,?? said Purnomo.Shares of Blue Bird are up 16 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent increase for the benchmark Jakarta Composite Index."

Pity the poor S&P 500 arb living off spreads well below 1 percent, or merger arbs in the U.S., where the median gap is just north of 1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.??Arbitrage will close that gap, but it will be days and weeks,?? Cboe Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said on Bloomberg Television Monday, less than a day after launching the product.Tilly discusses Monday's launch of the trading of futures contracts for bitcoin.Arbs make money when two strongly related assets converge in price, selling the one they consider pricey, buying the other, profiting off the difference.Their job is a little complicated with these futures. Bitcoin's wild volatility makes it harder to predict where the most-active contract, which expires in January, will settle, Tilly added. Only a few thousand contracts have traded so far, perhaps not enough to exert much influence on the cryptocurrency. And some investors might be willing to pay a premium for futures on a regulated market instead of going to the trouble of creating accounts at bitcoin exchanges, which have been repeatedly hacked with millions of dollars worth of tokens stolen.??People feel a lot more comfortable in the futures on the Cboe than on an unregulated exchange,?? said Kevin Kelly, managing partner of Benchmark Investments, which analyzes futures markets to develop indexes.?You Can Trade Bitcoin Futures.

Infosys is also being buffeted by changing technologies, and needs to switch from basic paid-by-the-hour activities like building software systems, which are fast getting automated, to higher-margin areas like digital services.Current Chairman Nandan Nilekani said Parekh ??has a strong track record of executing business turnarounds and managing very successful acquisitions,?? backed up by 30 years of experience in the?global IT services industry.Nilekani, the co-founder of Infosys, had returned as chairman after Sikka's exit and recast the board, soothing investor and employee concerns and bringing a degree of stability to the company.

Talks between the two companies have been on and off for a number of years, and the services are expected to be available from early 2019, BT said.??I want that product on as many platforms as possible,?? Marc Allera, head of BT's consumer business, said in an interview, referring to BT Sport. ??That's good for BT Sport and a good way for us to think about monetizing those rights.??BT and Sky are coming under investor scrutiny for the skyrocketing cost of sports rights, key to their pay-TV propositions, just as the entry by Amazon and Facebook Inc. into the fray puts them on the defensive. The cross-selling deal changes the competitive landscape ahead of next year's auction for U.K. rights to show the Premier League. Sky and BT together paid a record 5.14 billion pounds ($6.9 billion) for the live rights last time, an increase of 70 percent.???You could interpret it as being the two parties realizing that maybe the threat to them is not so much from each other, but maybe from other players like Netflix, Amazon, Google and so on,?? said Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg.Exclusive rights are a core part of BT's strategy, but there is a maximum price it's prepared to pay in the February blind auction, Allera said. He said he'd discussed the Sky partnership with Premier League Executive Chairman Richard Scudamore on Friday morning.Currently, BT TV customers can access ??main event packages?? from?Sky Sports, an inflexible 27.50 pound monthly bolt-on to their subscriptions. The new arrangement will let them access the 11 Sky Sports channels and NOW TV's entertainment content, which includes premium shows like HBO's Game of Thrones. Each provider will be able to decide how to bundle and charge for the new services, Allera said.Content providers and networks will need to seek further partnerships as consumers will want convenience rather than a cumbersome and expensive basket of fragmented subscriptions, Allera said.??It's about scale and choice, and you can't provide that choice by going alone in this marketplace,?? he said. ??It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're Apple, whether you're Facebook, whether you're Disney, whether you're Sky -- all of these companies will be acquiring and buying rights, and be increasingly active in this marketplace.??"

The latest sign that its becoming part of the mainstream came Friday when a key U.S. agency proposed that trading be regulated much like other commodities.Specifically, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission made clear to market participants that there could be penalties if they can't show buyers can take physical control of purchased digital coins in 28 days -- a framework that already applies to wheat, oil and gold.The long-existing rules that require traders and exchanges to be able to deliver?physical commodities has sowed some confusion for bitcoin because it's an asset class that exists only in cyberspace. What makes the issue even more complicated is that many investors are amplifying their bets with margin, or borrowed money.Read More: Coal Into Bitcoin? Dirty Secret of 2017's Hottest MarketBitcoin has jumped more than 1,700 percent in 2017, captivating everyone from retail investors to Hollywood celebrities. The digital currency has advanced 82 percent this month alone, a rise fueled by the CFTC's decision to allow bitcoin futures to begin trading on exchanges run by CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc.In its proposal, which the CFTC will seek public comment on for 90 days, the regulator said that if a trader can't take possession of a virtual currency bought on margin within about a month, the transaction will be treated as a futures contract. Futures contracts are subject to strict CFTC oversight, and failing to register them could subject firms to fines.The CFTC's proposed guidance could apply to U.S. exchanges or transactions overseas involving Americans.??The commission regulates retail commodity transactions, with the exception of contracts of sale that result in actual delivery within 28 days,?? the CFTC said in a 23-page document. ??The commission considers virtual currency to be a commodity.??The CFTC said it has faced questions about its views on the delivery of bitcoins since it sanctioned Bitfinex, one of the biggest digital token markets, last year.The regulator said Bitfinex broke the law because digital coins weren't provided to buyers in the required time frame. Instead, the platform ??held the purchased bitcoins in bitcoin deposit wallets that it owned and controlled,?? according to the CFTC. Bitfinex agreed to pay $75,000 to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations.Friday's proposal is the latest move by the CFTC to police virtual currencies, whose surge this year has largely caught regulators off-guard. CME, the world's biggest exchange operator, plans on Monday to begin offering cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts.

Teva may also seek to reset some debt covenants and extend bond maturities, the people said. The stock rose in New York.The world's biggest maker of copycat drugs, saddled with almost $35 billion in debt, may launch the refinancing plans as early as in January, the people said. No final decision has been made on the debt proposals, which may change or include other options, the people said. While lenders realize the company will take at least two or three years to recover, they are welcoming efforts to reduce debt load and cut expenses, the people said.??We're in constant discussions with our banks and rating agencies and prudently taking all measures to address our financial situation,?? a spokeswoman for Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva said in response to questions. A representative for Evercore didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.Shares of Teva rose as much as 1.7 percent before trading up 0.4 percent to $16.50 as of 10:16 a.m. in New York.?That pared the decline this year to about 54 percent, valuing the firm at about $16.8 billion. Debt-ridden Teva is considering cutting as many as 10,000 jobs and reducing expenses by $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next two years, with a little less than half of the cost cuts linked to research and development spending, people familiar with the matter have said. Schultz has said he'll present a detailed strategy in mid-December for Teva's recovery.Seeking ways to pay back almost $35 billion in debt, Teva has been selling assets, closing factories and firing employees in recent quarters following an ill-timed $40.5 billion acquisition in the generics industry. The company was forced on Nov. 2 to slash its 2017 profit forecast for a third time, pare its dividend, signal it may sell new shares, and reduce the goal for paying down debt this year. Teva's stock plummeted 20 percent following the announcement, on Schultz's second day on the job, and hit a 17-year low. Credit-rating firms are closely watching Schultz's moves, with the Israeli drugmaker's status as an investment grade company hanging in the balance.?In November, Fitch Ratings cut it to junk, citing the ??significant operational stress?? the company faces at a time when it needs to pay down debt. Both?Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have assigned it the lowest investment-grade rating, warning that another downgrade is possible.McClellan said that a downgrade to junk would lift the interest rates on Teva's $6 billion term loans by 0.25 percent. The company may look to refinance the $13.5 billion of bonds due in the next three years, in which case the rating cut would tack on up 1.5 percent to Teva's financing costs, he added.??

In October, four banks joined a venture started by UBS Group AG and International Business Machines Corp. to use the technology in a platform for the global goods trade. Natixis SA and Trafigura Group Ltd. announced in March they will employ the system to finance buying and selling oil.??We're talking about this massive change in the way that business is being done,?? said Eric Ervin, the chief executive officer of Reality Shares Inc., a San Diego fund manager that created an index to track returns of companies adopting the technology. ??Everything happens automatically, without a bunch of paperwork, processing and transferring.??Blockchain is an online ledger that records transactions using encryption to ensure security while allowing a network of users to verify them.?The most-prominent use was in bitcoin, which became a global sensation in 2017. Over the past year, as investors became more comfortable with how bitcoins and ledger systems work, the price of the cryptocurrency has surged more than 2,000 percent and touched a record this month of $17,578.45.While the bitcoin market relies on blockchain to transmit and store the value of each token, the transparent tracking technology has ??much greater potential?? across businesses that increasingly need to store and exchange massive amounts of data, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a Sept. 12 report.Farmers already see the possibilities. The government of Ukraine said in October it will use blockchain technology to manage its registry of crop land because the current systems is vulnerable to fraud that leads to ownership disputes. In sub-Saharan Africa, a fertilizer company and an exchange owner are using the technology to develop an agricultural commodity platform.The technology is a big selling point for the global food industry to identify counterfeit ingredients and to trace the source of contamination during product recalls. Michigan State University?estimated fraud costs the global food industry as much as $40 billion a year.

JD.com Inc., China's second-largest e-commerce platform, Wal-Mart, IBM and Tsinghua University said Thursday they'll work together to create a blockchain-based system for collecting data about the origin, safety and authenticity of food.The growing use of blockchain means ??the opportunity to transform what is fundamentally the underlying infrastructure to every transaction that happens with consumers and business-to-business,?? Brigid McDermott, IBM vice president of blockchain, said in a telephone interview.De Beers is investing in a blockchain platform that traces the origin of diamonds in a bid to boost confidence in an industry that has been marred by the sale of gems from war zones.??Now more than ever, consumers expect to know more about their?luxury goods, the route they have traveled, their authenticity, and whether they have been a force for good in the world,?? Bruce Cleaver, chief executive officer of De Beers, said in a blog post on the company's website. ?Blockchain also is becoming a key tool for shipping?companies. AP Moller-Maersk A/S in March disclosed a ledger system with IBM that will help manage and track the paper trail of tens of millions of shipping containers. About $16 trillion of physical raw materials are transported around the planet each year, and better tracking offers the promise of big reductions in record-keeping costs. Current spending on documentation alone accounts for 7 percent of global trade, according to the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation.Still, widespread adoption of blockchain systems may take a while because the transition to new systems will be disruptive and requires some investment. There's also concern about the potential risk of putting all that data online.In July, CoinDash, a blockchain technology startup, said its website was hacked and $7 million was stolen from investors trying to participate in the company's initial coin offering. In November, Tether Ltd. disclosed on its website that a ??malicious?? attacker swiped $31 million in tokens and sent them to an unauthorized bitcoin address.??So many things could go wrong,???said Peter Thomas, a senior vice president in Chicago for Zaner Group LLC, a commodity trader. ??Before I have faith in it, we're going to have to see it work for a while.??Some aren't waiting.Blockchain ??brings some much-needed innovation?? in an industry where the current process has been ??paper and labor intensive,???Arnaud Stevens, Natixis' New York-based head of global energy & commodities, said when the new system was announced in March.European utility companies Enel SpA and RWE AG joined a project to test blockchain-based trades in wholesale power and natural gas markets.?TenneT Holding BV is looking at the technology to manage power grids that are preparing to accommodate the growing volume of renewable energy. Vemanti Group Inc. said Dec. 12 it will invest in a Singapore-based company developing a blockchain-based platform energy trading.There was even a proposal this month by the president of Venezuela, where the domestic currency is in freefall because of economic sanctions and a long recession, of creating digital petrocurrencies backed by the country's reserves of oil, gas, gold and diamonds. This week, a group announced plans to use blockchain to create OilCoin,?a U.S.-government regulated digital currency that would be backed by crude.Consumers could also benefit from wider adoption of the technology. In Thailand,?power producer BCPG Pcl said last month it plans to use the blockchain to allow customers who produce energy through solar rooftops to engage in internet-based energy trading.??The potential is huge to increase efficiency and to create value propositions,?? said Harry Smit, a Utrecht-based analyst at Rabobank. ??Once you've established blockchain and it's working, you will see faster changes, because then the transformation of the value chain becomes an option.?? ???

While the program has been praised for reducing fraud and preventing leakages, it's been criticized for not paying enough attention to issues including privacy and data security.The study was done in partnership with consultancy MicroSave and surveyed 633 households in rural and urban areas of Rajasthan. The group represented a variety of income and landholding categories, with 64 percent of respondents being women.??The mandating of welfare payments to female heads of the family is changing local level dynamics and age-old hierarchies,"" said Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and one of the authors of the study. ??In many villages, women are setting out in groups to go to the bank, it's a visible?change,?? he said in a phone interview.The survey included sections on financial inclusion, empowerment, user experience as well as perception.In Rajasthan, a state known to be patriarchal, the requirement for the family head to be female drove a massive increase in banking use with 66 percent of the female heads of family opening accounts when they didn't have one before registration.However, men still control the use of mobile phones as only about a third of the households had a female head who can read and write text messages.??What the debate was missing so far was data,??

The company will also need to persuade existing customers to embrace its phone services.The prospect of improved fees and services was welcomed by the government, which has been pushing for more competition.??Households are weighed down by mobile phone charges,???Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Thursday. ??But there isn't much competition because the three large carriers put forth similar plans and fees.??In 2015, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said mobile phone contracts were too expensive and called for them to be cut. Since then, prices of phone-service contracts have fallen for 25 straight months, on a year-on year basis. The government set up a task force which pushed to increase competition by raising the number of mobile operators who don't have their own wireless network infrastructure.??The Japanese authorities were already putting pressure on existing carriers to cut tariffs, so having Rakuten coming into the market is heaven sent,?? said Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore. ??Competition in Japan's wireless market is only going to get more fierce as it has in the U.S.??He said Rakuten's aggressive push into mobile is being driven by pressure from Jeff Bezos, whose Amazon.com Inc. has been winning over Japanese customers through free shipping and online streaming. That's left Mikitani with little choice but to prop up cash flow by seeking ventures outside its main business, said Anvarzadeh.Rakuten already has a track record of successfully branching off into other industries, mostly notably in financial services where it operates a credit card and brokerage business. Financial products accounted for 35 percent of Rakuten's revenue for 2016, and?Anvarzadeh said the company should be able to win over existing customers with its mobile business.A move into the mobile business will require a ??very large amount?? of capital investment, said Yoshihiro Nakatani, senior fund manager at Asahi Life Asset Management Co. ??No company has ever succeeded other than the three major carriers?? in Japan, he said. ??The risks involved are quite high.??Rakuten declined to comment on whether it will issue bonds for its mobile project, according to spokeswoman Chiemi Kobayashi. ??We will study various means in consultation with credit ratings companies and financial institutions from which we are planning to borrow,?? she said.Rakuten has operated a discount mobile carrier service since 2014, where it leases network infrastructure from NTT Docomo, according to Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley. Rakuten was the biggest player among discount carriers with 17 percent of the so-called Kakuyasu SIM services market, according to MMD Labo's Yoshimoto.Rakuten's ability to meet its 15 million subscribers goal may come down to further undercutting rivals, which they could have more freedom to do by winning the government auctions.??Having their own infrastructure means they can be a lot more aggressive with the pricing,?? said Anvarzadeh."""

In a mission for NASA, SpaceX will reuse both a rocket and a capsule that it's fired off before.Making space missions work more like commercial airline flights dramatically reduces costs -- less money gets wasted discarding rockets and spacecraft after single launches. SpaceX's success in this pursuit has made it one of the world's most richly valued private companies. It's also won over customers including NASA, which President Donald Trump has directed to return to the moon and explore Mars with the help of private industry.??At this point, the notion of reuse of hardware is almost unremarkable,?? said Ernie Chung, an aerospace, defense and airline consultant at AlixPartners LLP. ??What is remarkable is that SpaceX appears to be continuing to lead the march down the cost curve for space access.??A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Dec 7, 2017 at 7:22pm PSTTrump on Monday issued a space directive that barely differs from a memo his predecessor issued in 2010, changing only a paragraph in which Barack Obama had called for NASA to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to orbit Mars by the mid-2030s. Trump scrapped the asteroid mission and revived ambitions to return to the moon, but set no time frame for going there or to Mars.The White House didn't provide details about how NASA's moon or Mars missions would be funded. Both SpaceX and Boeing Co. have billion-dollar contracts to send American astronauts to the International Space Station, with the first key tests of the technology slated for 2018. Musk has announced plans to send paying tourists on flights around the moon next year.A Falcon 9 rocketIn the meantime, SpaceX has been carrying out a series of unmanned missions for NASA. The company plans to ferry supplies to the space station?using a pre-flown Falcon 9 rocket and a refurbished Dragon cargo capsule. The purpose of the mission,?called CRS-13, will be to carry 4,800 pounds of research, crew supplies and hardware.Related: Elon Musk Is Getting SpaceX Closer to Mars, One Rocket at a TimeWhile parts of the Space Shuttle boosters NASA flew for decades were refurbishable, no company has pulled off the ??rapid reusability?? SpaceX is targeting to bring down costs. SpaceX launched its first reused Falcon 9 rocket booster in March and reused a Dragon capsule on a space-station resupply mission in June.CRS-13 will be the first launch in more than a year from the Florida launch pad that was significantly damaged when a Falcon 9 rocket exploded there in September 2016. SpaceX has delayed the mission twice this week to conduct additional checks, inspections and cleanings after it detected particles in one of its rocket's fueling systems.SpaceX spent roughly $50 million to rebuild and upgrade Space Launch Complex 40 after the accident last year, which destroyed the rocket and the satellite it was slated to carry into orbit. Work to refurbish the damaged site began in earnest in February, with upgrades including an improved water system that will allow for longer ??static fires?? when a SpaceX rocket's Merlin engines are tested ahead of a launch.The launch complex was originally built in the 1960s, John Muratore, director of the launch complex for SpaceX, told reporters during a conference call Friday.??We found plumbing and wiring in places we didn't expect them to be,?? he said. ??We saw opportunities to really improve the pad and did a complete rebuild of the entire electrical system.??Read More: SpaceX Restores Pad It Damaged in 2016, Enabling More LaunchesWhile the site?at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was out of commission, SpaceX moved its Falcon 9 launches to Pad 39A at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Now that the damaged site has been fixed, SpaceX can resume launching its smaller Falcon 9 there while readying the?Kennedy Space Center pad for the maiden flight of its larger Falcon Heavy rocket, which is capable of carrying heavier payloads. SpaceX also uses a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.The closely held company, based in Hawthorne, California, has already flown 16 missions in 2017. While that's double its number in 2016, SpaceX may fall short of a goal for at least 20 this year.?? With assistance by Jennifer Jacobs, and Jennifer Epstein"

In most developed countries, like the U.S., the wireless market has reached saturation, and there are few new subscribers to sign up without undercutting rivals on price.??Historically, 1G to 4G, it's been a pretty straightforward evolution from the point of view of business and technology,?? said Chetan Sharma, a wireless consultant. ??The revenue grew proportionate to the usage.??The future of 5G, as the next-generation wireless network is known, is already beginning, as a handful of carriers including Verizon Communications Inc. move from trials to deployments. The first technical standards everyone can use to design their networks, phones and chips for 5G will be released at a summit that starts Monday in Lisbon.Most mobile-phone companies are targeting 2020 for the initial rollout of the technology, which promises 10 times faster speeds and lower latency, or lag time in transferring data when it's requested. After that, wireless carriers' revenue will grow about 2.5 percent a year through 2025 -- only about half a percentage point more than their growth in the prior five years, according to industry group GSMA.This time around, it's not clear that 5G will translate into more revenue until perhaps five or 10 years from now, Sharma said. New applications like the Internet of Things -- using wireless connectivity to let machines on the factory floor talk to each other, and for autonomous cars on the freeway to talk to light signals -- may take years to materialize, and may not pay that much. After all, many of these applications can be handled by Wi-Fi networks, while others -- like driverless cars - would likely use onboard communications rather than cellular for safety reasons, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson LLC.??What's left in the middle is undoubtedly still a real opportunity, but it's not clear it's a very big one,?? he said.First, engineers have to figure out how to make 5G work. Rain, fog and trees have long been the enemy of high frequency radio waves. AT&T Inc. is among the companies that have been exploring the problem. With environmental conditions ??you get degradations but we haven't lost signals completely,?? said Andre Fuetsch, president of AT&T Labs and chief technology officer.Given the relatively short, fragile nature of high-frequency 5G signals, carriers have to configure networks differently. They're shifting more of the network hardware from tall towers that are scattered to spread signals over broad areas, to smaller, more clustered sites like rooftops and street poles.These ??small cells?? use cabinets that look like mini-refrigerators mounted on poles or rooftops. Inside the cabinets there's an array of more than 1,000 antennas, says Ed Chan, senior vice president of network planning for Verizon. In dense, urban areas, network engineers will have to install lots of small cells to handle demand for data, adding to the costs of 5G.Some companies, including Verizon, aim to make money by offering up 5G as an alternative to home broadband connections, competing with cable and landline phone providers. High costs could make that commercially unviable.??Carriers are all looking at 5G for fixed wireless broadband, even though the technology isn't particularly well suited to that application,?? Moffett said. ??That's largely because it is almost impossible to identify any other real revenue opportunities for the technology.??Verizon says it will take a targeted approach, which will require a few years of spending before there's enough 5G service to prove that it can be a viable source of revenue.The company has told analysts and investors that the goal for the first phase of its 5G network is to build a coverage area of 30 million homes starting next year in Sacramento, California, and possibly four additional cities. It will take a ??short number of years?? of network investment to have 5G within reach of that many homes and a few years before it shows some returns, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said at a UBS investor conference earlier this month.??As we've seen with other products, you build up to your penetration levels over some period of time,?? Ellis said. After enough customers sign on, it ??starts to be significant to our financials in the next two to three years,?? he said.Each of the top four wireless carriers in the U.S. decided to take different paths with 5G. AT&T plans to sell both a direct-to-home wireless service and a mobile service. T-Mobile US Inc. is adapting its network to 5G through a software update, and Sprint Corp. is planning to upgrade its antenna towers with advanced network gear. Neither T-Mobile nor Sprint have specified how they plan to generate revenue from 5G.Verizon and AT&T have been testing the 5G technology in controlled settings. The trials have gone well enough to take the service to consumers starting late next year.Sprint plans to boost network spending from about $4 billion this year to as much as $6 billion in 2018 as it kicks off a four-part upgrade plan, Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said at an investor conference earlier this month.T-Mobile, meanwhile, is saying it will be the first to offer 5G service nationwide, though it's not clear if they're referring to the same type of technology others are implementing.??The capital we're putting in the ground, starting now, is future ready,'' Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert said this month at the same conference. ??We're not hyping it right now like our competitors because we actually have a story in the part of a business where the revenues and profits are.??"

Lukashenko said in a statement in his website. ??We have every chance of becoming a regional center in this area.??The decree legalizes business based on blockchain -- the technology underlying cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin -- and all digital ??tokens,???as Belarus seeks to become a global hub for raising funds via so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs. Revenue and profit from all operations using digital tokens will be exempt from taxes until 2023, while there'll be measures to simplify the flow of venture capital between Belarus and other countries, according to a summary of the decree published by Viktor Prokopenya, one of the businessmen lobbying for the legislation. Belarus is seeking to capitalize on a thriving tech industry that's grown up there in recent years as young programmers have created products that appeal far beyond the borders of the former Soviet republic. The phone messaging application Viber was developed in Belarus as were the NYSE-listed offshore programming company EPAM Systems Inc. and the popular online gaming service World of Tanks, which made founder Victor Kislyi the country's first billionaire.?Even as Alphabet Inc., owner of Google, and Facebook Inc. snapped up Belarus-made startups, the country's restrictive business environment made it all but impossible for venture capital to flow freely into promising ideas.?Lukashenko's new law may change that.?Belarus plans to cloak its repressive reputation with a ??sandbox?? -- the creation of a legal tech enclave where companies working with digital currencies will pay no taxes and rely on some elements of English law in commercial matters, a radical innovation for a country whose security service is still called the KGB.The sandbox would be set up within the so-called Hi-Tech Park, which the authorities opened in 2005 near the capital, Minsk, to try to spur innovation. Today, most of the park's? residents are offshore software companies taking advantage of cheap and skilled local programmers as well as reduced taxes to serve foreign clients.Lukashenko said this month that his goal in signing the decree is to make Belarus a ??tech nation.?? The country's major technology companies lobbied for the legal changes, which also gained support among government officials and in the central bank.?The novelty of the proposed law is that Belarus would provide legal clarity for dealing in digital currencies which is yet unseen in other countries, said Denis Aleinikov, whose law firm Aleinikov and Partners helped to draft the decree. It also establishes a direct legal link between issuers of tokens and their obligations toward the holders.To protect against fraudsters, the regulation would set capital requirements for operators of cryptocurrency exchanges. It would also introduce ??smart contracts?? in Belarus -- self-executable computer-coded applications that serve as an alternative to traditional paper agreements.??The decree has been written exactly the way our tech community wanted it,???Vsevolod Yanchevsky, head of Hi-Tech Park, said in an interview in Minsk. ??Belarus will be one of the best jurisdictions in the world for cryptocurrencies and blockchain.??"

Media and telecom companies have relatively high effective tax rates and are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of lower taxes, so investors have poured into the sectors in recent weeks as it became clearer that U.S. tax reform would become law in 2018. Some analysts expect this trend to continue into next year. ?Tax reform is also expected to boost telecom carriers' capex plans, which Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees helping telecom equipment companies. AT&T Inc. has already announced it will increase its capex by $1 billion in 2018 as a result of the tax reform bill's passage in Congress.Another major theme for 2018 is consolidation. In wireless, the Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. deal seems to be off the table and removes a fundamental overhang for tower stocks. But in media, analysts expect more M&A as content players seek to gain scale and negotiating leverage with carriers as new distribution platforms proliferate. Smaller and mid-sized content companies may seek to merge, following the lead of giants Walt Disney Co. and Twenty-First Century Fox. The loosening of?TV station ownership regulation in 2018 may also drive consolidation in the broadcasting sector analysts say."

Still, potential customs hurdles, regulatory changes, and lingering doubts over the rights of more than 2 million EU workers need to be addressed before companies can hire and spend with confidence, executives say.??Businesses need certainty in order to invest, so it's fantastic news?? about the initial deal, ??but it doesn't really give us more certainty yet,?? Rob Perrins, chief executive officer of property developer Berkeley Group Holdings Plc, said in a phone interview. ??We will have to wait for details on the actual trade deal for that.?? The?FTSE 100 company has blamed Brexit for weakness in the London housing market.The agreement reached Friday was the easy part, said global accounting giant KPMG LLP. Sticking points such as the Irish border could easily recur in even more dramatic fashion as the U.K. and EU discuss policies that will affect supply chains, logistics and capital expenditure, said Karen Briggs, the firm's head of Brexit. A recent survey of chief financial officers found that Brexit continues to hold the biggest sway over companies' appetite for risk, said Deloitte LLP, another Big Four auditor.Some financial companies aren't waiting around to see what happens. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan said the breakthrough doesn't alter the bank's plans to establish an alternative trading hub inside the EU. Banks still have to plan for the worst, he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.Luxury carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. hopes for a trading settlement as close to the status quo as possible, because the company imports parts from across the world and exports the majority of its finished products, CEO Andy Palmer said in an interview. ??Having clarity on direction by the end of March is mandatory,?? assuming a two-year transition, he said, to factor any changes into forward planning.Friday's joint statement from U.K. and EU negotiators pledged the right of European workers to stay in the U.K. and vice versa -- a cause for relief, said the British Chambers of Commerce and the Institute of Directors. However, those rights must be enshrined even in the event that talks collapse, they said.For the workers from abroad, ??this cannot be their second Christmas where their rights are dependent on negotiations,?? the Confederation of British Industry said in an emailed statement.Television producer Endemol Shine U.K., which creates shows including Big Brother and MasterChef, said maintaining frictionless trade will be key,?since the company makes significant revenues from the sale of its programs and TV formats to Europe. ??If no deal meant tariffs on exports, that would obviously be a big issue for us,?? said CEO?Richard Johnston. ??Provided we avoid tariffs, I'm slightly more relaxed.??Sectors including the pharmaceutical and defense industries also welcomed the step forwards with similar caveats. It's now ??crucial that the regulation and supply of medicines for U.K. and EU patients is prioritized,?? said the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, which says 500 million patients rely on minimizing disruption. Agreement on a transition must be reached as soon as possible, said the aerospace and defense group ADS.In contrast to other companies' push for a cooperative approach, Tim Martin, chairman of pub operator JD Wetherspoon Plc and one of the leading business voices advocating for Brexit in the run-up to the referendum in June 2016, said the initial accord reached overnight showed the U.K. would be better off without a deal. Members of parliament would have the right to eliminate food tariffs from non-EU imports, which would give British pub-goers more spending power, Martin said in an interview.??My main worry is that the CBI and British Retail Consortium have successfully persuaded and misled the MPs and the public by saying food prices will rise unless there is a deal, and that is completely untrue,?? said Martin, who will be campaigning to eliminate food tariffs and not pay any money to the EU during the transition period. Wetherspoon imports about 30 percent of its food from outside the EU.Growers of British food are keen?for the current ??fogginess?? to clear.???This is only the beginning of the beginning,?? said Nick Wallis, a farmer and managing director of Ridgeway Grain, which stores and processes grain near Newbury. Farmers expect subsidies to decline and are restructuring to cope. So far, the U.K. government has only guaranteed to bridge the gap in EU agriculture subsidies until 2022.??If they hadn't struck a deal the process would have taken another month or two, so I am pretty sanguine about the whole thing,?? he added.??

Those talks were suspended last week without resolution on what price miners will pay to get their copper refined in 2018. China is the biggest producer and consumer of refined copper and relies on some of the world's biggest miners for its raw material.??If the curbs are enacted in more regions, or nationwide, that will affect demand for copper concentrate,?? said Wang, adding that the company has yet to resume the negotiations.Tongling's willingness to halt capacity shows just how much pressure is generated by the negotiations, Ji Xianfei, an analyst with Guotai Junan Futures Ltd., said by phone from Shanghai, ??It's also really hard to say how much, and how long the cuts will last,?? Ji said. ??The battle is intense during the annual talks.??Even before the deadlock, the negotiations were taking longer than in previous years, Ivan Arriagada, chief executive officer of Chilean miner Antofagasta Plc, said in an interview last week.While miners contend that ore is in short supply, which should spur a drop in fees, China's smelters say they are being forced to upgrade facilities to comply with environmental rules, and charges should reflect their higher costs.Copper rose as much 1.1 percent to $6,620 a ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $6,589 by 1:59 p.m. in London. The metal closed at a three-year high of $7,134.50 in October, but has since retreated due to worries over slowing growth in China.Anhui province's government issued its order asking polluting industries such as steel, cement, and nonferrous metals to cut capacity by more than 30 percent this winter, a local newspaper reported last month.??

A Drone That Went Undetected In New York ??No-Fly' Zone Highlights Risks,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/drone-s-ease-piercing-new-york-no-fly-zone-underscores-risks,"December 14, 2017, 1:22 PM EST",technology,"""Device struck Army helicopter Sept. 21 near Staten Island"", ""NTSB releases report on first U.S. midair drone collision""","A recreational drone operator whose device smashed into a U.S. Army helicopter in September flew undetected into a no-fly zone over New York set up to protect President Donald Trump and the United Nations.The National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday said the drone flew in air space closed because of the visit by Trump, highlighting gaps in safety and security protections involving the devices that are the size of a medium pizza box. Moreover, the pilot was in Brooklyn but the drone was 2.5 miles away, offshore of Staten Island, violating a rule that operators must keep drones in their sight.??This incident reveals a soft underbelly of drone safety: we're putting very sophisticated drones in the hands of unsophisticated operators, with no training, certificates, or knowledge requirements,?? said Kenneth Quinn, former chief counsel for the Federal Aviation Administration who now works at the law firm Baker McKenzie.The incident highlighted the need for drones to be treated more like traditional aircraft, such as requiring them to send an identifying radio beacon so they can be tracked, Quinn said. The current situation is ??a recipe for disaster,?? he said.The crash occurred on Sept. 21 as light was fading in the evening. The Black Hawk helicopter suffered damage to one of its rotor blades, but was able to land safely.?The collision was the first confirmed midair impact in the U.S. between a manned aircraft and one of the millions of drones sold in recent years. Reports of safety incidents involving drones have climbed steadily, and averaged more than 200 a month last summer, according to federal data.The helicopter was one of two flying in the area as part of the security efforts for the United Nations General Assembly, which was meeting that week. Trump had spoken to the UN two days earlier and security restrictions for his visit were still in effect.The NTSB report comes as the FAA is wrestling with multiple drone-safety issues. They include whether to allow routine flights over people, which drones should be required to send radio beacons with their identity and location, and how to build a low-level air-traffic system for the small consumer flying devices.The recreational operator told investigators he didn't know that federal authorities had temporarily banned all drone flights in New York.?A notification system included with the device, made by?SZ DJI Technology Co., didn't advise him of those flight restrictions, the NTSB said.While the accident occurred at an altitude of 274 feet (84 meters), the drone operator had earlier flown to a height of 547 feet, above the FAA's 400-foot flight limit, the NTSB said. When it reached that height the device was 1.8 miles away from the operator, where it would have been difficult to see any other aircraft, according to the report.Read More: Amazon's Dream of Drone Delivery Gets Closer With Trump Move??Even though the sUAS pilot indicated that he knew there were frequently helicopters in the area, he still elected to fly his sUAS beyond visual line of sight, demonstrating his lack of understanding of the potential hazard of collision,?? the report said.The leading U.S. group for model aircraft operators called on the FAA to act against the drone operator.???Careless and reckless operators should be held accountable,?? Chad Budreau, spokesman for the Academy of Model Aeronautics, said in a statement. ??The rogue drone operator involved in this incident violated Part 107 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and a temporary flight restriction, among other irresponsible behavior.??The FAA regulates drones and has fined operators in the past.??We will take appropriate action upon the completion of our investigation,"" the FAA said in a statement. ""The FAA provides education and resources for operators to safely and responsibly operate their drones.??The drone was a DJI Phantom 4, a small device made by the world's largest civilian unmanned aircraft manufacturer.It's equipped with what's known as ??geo-fencing,?? designed to prevent operators from flying in prohibited zones. However, ??this feature is intended for advisory use only, and sUAS pilots are responsible at all times to comply with FAA airspace restrictions,?? the NTSB said.Read More: FAA Warns of Drone Impact Risks With Airplanes as Use GrowsIn addition, DJI had temporarily shut off its flight-restriction advisories as it worked to resolve glitches in the system, according to the report.Even if the system had been functioning, it wouldn't have alerted the drone operator, the NTSB said. He was guiding the drone with a tablet computer, but it wasn't connected to the internet and thus couldn't download the information on the FAA's flight restrictions.??DJI believes pilot education is the most important factor to ensure drones share the skies safely with other aircraft, and has led the industry with technology to accomplish this goal,?? the company said in a statement.The company recently began an educational initiative that requires new drone pilots to pass a safety quiz before taking initial flights. The quiz was developed in collaboration with FAA, the company said.Small drones like the one involved in the New York collision weigh only a few pounds, but they contain metal motors and cameras that can cause significant damage to a jetliner at high speeds, a study commissioned by the FAA found in November. While the study found it was unlikely a drone impact alone could take down an airliner, it could cause enough damage to shut down a jet engine.FAA incident reports include numerous examples of drones flying close to passenger airplanes or beyond legal restrictions. For example, on Sept. 28, pilots on a Boeing Co. 737-800 that had just taken off from Chicago O'Hare International Airport reported spotting a drone at 9,000 feet altitude. The aircraft is a widely used airliner; the name of the carrier wasn't identified.The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is also looking into an incident in Quebec on Oct. 12 in which a small drone struck a charter flight carrying six passengers. The plane suffered minor damage to its left wing and landed safely."
These Guys Want to Lend You Money Against Your Bitcoin,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/bitcoin-s-new-barons-no-longer-have-to-sell-to-live-in-luxury,"December 14, 2017, 12:00 AM EST",technology,"""Lenders offer loans with digital coins as collateral"", ""‘I would be very interested in doing this,' Bitcoin Jesus says""","The woes of an early bitcoin investor. Until recently, people who paid virtually nothing for the virtual currency and watched it soar had only one way to enjoy their new wealth -- sell. And many weren't ready.Lenders on the fringe of the financial industry are now?pitching a solution: loans using a digital hoard as collateral.While banks hang back, startups with names like Salt Lending, Nebeus, CoinLoan and EthLend are diving into the breach. Some lend -- or plan to lend -- directly, while others help borrowers get financing from third parties. Terms can be onerous compared with traditional loans. But the market is potentially huge.Bitcoin's price hovered around $17,000 much of this week, giving the cryptocurrency a total market value of almost $300 billion. Roughly 40 percent of that is held by something like 1,000 users. That's a lot of digital millionaires needing houses, yachts and $590 shearling eye masks.Roger Ver??I would be very interested in doing this with my own holdings, but I haven't found a service to enable this yet,?? said Roger Ver, widely known as ??Bitcoin Jesus?? for his proselytizing on behalf of the cryptocurrency, in which he in one of the largest holders.Read More: The bitcoin whales who own 40 percent of the marketPeople controlling about 10 percent of the digital currency would probably like to use it as collateral, estimates?Aaron Brown, a former managing director at AQR Capital Management who invests in bitcoin and writes for Bloomberg Prophets. ??So I can see a lending industry in the tens of billions of dollars,?? he said.One problem is that bitcoin's price swings violently, which can make it dangerous for lenders to hold. That means the terms can be steep.Someone looking to tap $100,000 in cash would probably need to put up $200,000 of bitcoin as collateral, and pay 12 percent to 20 percent in interest a year, according to David Lechner, the chief financial officer at Salt, which has arranged dozens of loans.That's in line with interest rates for unsecured personal loans. The difference is that putting up bitcoin lets people borrow more.The new loans should be of particular interest to miners, whose computers?solve complex math problems to obtain new coins and help confirm transactions, Brown said. They have to pay for electricity and equipment. But, like many bitcoin believers, they don't like to sell their crypto. Bitcoin startups also need cash to pay employees.Read a QuickTake: All about bitcoin, blockchain and their crypto worldLate last month, London-based startup Nebeus began helping third-party lenders offer loans backed by bitcoin and ether, another cryptocurrency. The firm arranged almost 100 such loans on the first day, according to Konstantin Zaripov, the company's managing director. It has since done more than 1,000.Salt offers loans and plans to eventually help banks do so too. It's talking with financial institutions and aims to strike a deal with at least one of them ??within weeks,?? Lechner said.Some companies also require a second form of collateral. Terms can include maintenance calls, requiring borrowers to post more bitcoin if the price drops. That's similar to the margin that a dozen or so cryptocurrency exchanges already offer clients so they can ramp up their trading bets.In a twist, some lenders are hoping to use blockchains -- digital ledgers akin to those underpinning bitcoin -- to facilitate lending. The idea is to stitch terms into a ledger to help automate the loan and collections. If they take off, the model could challenge peer-to-peer lenders -- such as LendingClub Corp., Prosper Marketplace Inc. and Zopa Ltd. -- by offering debt investors more reliable repayment, according to Lucas Nuzzi, a senior analyst at Digital Asset Research.??Although this has the potential of revolutionizing credit markets, we are still in the very early stages of development,?? Nuzzi said. ??No companies have been able to fully implement such a system.??For now, banks are largely on the sidelines, reluctant to offer services that could leave them holding bitcoins.?Some firms don't have a secure way to store cryptocurrency. And there's no established model to account for it on a regulated balance sheet.Still, that could change, said Josh Galper, managing principal of Finadium LLC, a consulting firm that focuses on securities finance.??The more comfort that banks have in trading digital currencies, the more comfortable they will be accepting bitcoin as collateral,?? Galper said. ??I don't see this coming tomorrow, but I could see this happening in two to three years.???? With assistance by Dakin Campbell"

So far this year, startups have raised a record $3.67 billion by issuing tokens, according to another tracker, CoinSchedule. That's even after one in five ICOs failed in the third quarter, Token Report said.While the industry is red hot, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton reiterated Monday that many token sales are effectively securities that should be registered with the agency. Clayton added that investors should be on high alert for promoters promising guaranteed returns, and he warned market participants about touting ICOs without determining whether they comply with securities regulations.??Any such activity that involves an offering of securities must be accompanied by the important disclosures, processes and other investor protections that our securities laws require,?? Clayton said in a statement. ??Investors should understand that to date, no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC.??The SEC separately announced Monday that a San Francisco-based make of a restaurant-review app had halted a planned $15 million ICO after the regulator questioned whether the offering should have been registered as a security. Munchee Inc. faced a cease-and-desist order, but the SEC said it wasn't fined because it quickly stopped the ICO and returned proceeds to investors. The company didn't admit or deny wrongdoing.On Dec. 4, the SEC won an emergency asset freeze to stop an ICO that the agency said has defrauded investors by promising a 13-fold profit in less than a month. The case was the first brought by a new SEC unit created in September to focus on misconduct involving distributed ledger technology and ICOs.For months, Clayton and the SEC have been raising concerns that crooks are harnessing the technology to pull off a scam that is about as old as markets themselves: talking up an asset and then selling at an inflated price once the dumb money pours in.??Experience shows that excessive touting in thinly traded and volatile markets can be an indicator of scalping, pump-and-dump, and other manipulations,?? Clayton said in his Monday statement.?? With assistance by Matt Robinson"
BMW Aims for a 50% Increase in Electric Vehicle Sales Next Year,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/bmw-guns-for-a-50-increase-in-electric-vehicle-sales-next-year,"December 4, 2017, 6:00 PM EST",climate-changed,"""Company flags e-car expansion saving rights for iX1 to iX9 SUV"", ""X7, 8-Series to battle Mercedes in top-line segment share""","BMW AG?is targeting another ambitious hike in plug-in hybrid and battery car sales next year to defend its position in the electric-car shift as competitors like Volkswagen AG ready their own battery?lineups.The planned increase to about 150,000 cars sold would represent a 50 percent rise from this year, and a jump of about two-thirds from last year's deliveries of green cars. BMW, an early mover in the electric-car shift with 2013's i3, is facing increasing competition from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.A BMW i3 electric automobile??We'll definitely boost sales by a mid-double digit amount,'' Klaus Froehlich, who heads development for BMW, told reporters in Munich. ??This is to stay ahead of the competition that's starting to do its own rollout.??'Faced with tightening emissions regulation, BMW and other carmakers are spending record amounts developing a more attractive suite of electric cars to kick-start sluggish consumer sales. The payoff remains uncertain, as high battery prices will squeeze returns compared to equivalent combustion engine vehicles -- at least for a number of years. Demand for the vehicles remains at a fraction of total auto sales, with BMW's target paling compared to its total 2016 deliveries of 2.4 million vehicles.To help pay for the shift, BMW will start sales next year of the all-new X7 SUV and 8-Series coupe, priced at around 100,000 euros ($119,000). The expanded top-line segment will go head-to-head with Mercedes-Benz's luxury variants like the S-Class coupe and Maybach sub-brand. Unlike Mercedes's parent Daimler AG, also the world's biggest commercial vehicle maker, or 12-brand behemoth Volkswagen, BMW has less opportunity to spread development costs of its suite of at least 12 all-electric cars by 2025. Volkswagen plans to offer 50 battery cars by then.BMW's X7 SUV and BMW 8-Series concept electric vehicle??Our goal for the luxury segment in the next few years is taking more market share,'' Chief Executive Officer Harald Krueger said in speech notes, adding that the new suite of luxury cars will be sold under the ??Bayerische Motoren Werke'' signature. ??In 2018, we're significantly enlarging our offering in this lucrative growth segment.''BMW is in the midst of a record rollout of 40 all-new and revamped vehicles this year and next, seeking to wrest back global leadership of luxury car sales from Mercedes. Its Stuttgart, Germany-based rival overtook BMW last year for the first time in a decade, after overhauling a stodgy lineup with sportier styling and adding new models.BMW's electric push coincides with the biggest transformation for the industry in decades, drawing in a host of new competitors like Tesla Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.?BMW last month flagged it'll spend 7 billion euros on research and development this year, as much as 2011 and 2012 taken together.?Mercedes, meanwhile, said it's targeting savings of 4 billion euros by 2025, saying returns on electric cars could be roughly half of gasoline and diesel vehicles for some years. The concerns about mastering the pressures have pushed the valuations of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen to the bottom four?rungs in the DAX Index.BMW's struggles with slow sales of the i3 city car, which used a lightweight carbon-fiber body for the first time in a mass-produced vehicle, prompted the carmaker to dial back its electric ambitions and pause from adding more electric-only models to its lineup.Next year, it's bringing out an electric Mini, followed by a battery-powered X3 sport utility vehicle in 2020, adding electric powertrains to existing models rather than creating a distinct, separate lineup like Mercedes's planned 10-auto EQ range.?The approach will give BMW the option to tailor output of plug-ins and electric cars to yet-uncertain demand. However, flexible production setups are also usually more expensive and might require some compromises in some models to fit batteries, Warburg Research analyst Marc-Rene Tonn wrote in a report.In the future, BMW will bundle its electric model versions under its ??i' brand, and has reserved naming rights for models iX1 through iX9.??This can't be just about showcase cars,'' said Froehlich. ??We have to boost profitability and keep prices on an acceptable level by delving very, very deeply into our cost structure.''"

But an unforeseen trade case filed in April has roiled the U.S. solar industry, boosting prices and driving some developers to hoard panels, and the company suddenly had customers clamoring for anything it could make. President Donald Trump may impose tariffs on imported solar panels, with a final decision expected by mid-January.First Solar will continue to make the Series 4 ??as long as there's demand,?? Chief Executive Officer Mark Widmar said during a company event at its factory in Perrysburg, Ohio. ??We came to this really unexpected place where supply and demand came into balance and prices stabilized,?? he said in an interview.The company showed off the first Series 6 at the event and said the panel will go into production in the second quarter. By 2020, it expects to be making 5.4 gigawatts of them a year, at the Ohio factory and facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia. The Malaysia plant is also where it's still producing the Series 4. First Solar shares gained 4.5 percent to $63.97 at 10:28 a.m. in New York.??We were surprised by the magnitude of cost reductions that have made S4 attractive compared to Chinese competition even without the potential regulatory advantage, with gross margin expectations of 15 to 20 percent including freight and warranty costs,?? Jeff Osborne, a New York-based analyst at Cowen & Co., said in a research note Wednesday.First Solar is forecasting sales of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2018, and earnings of $1.25 to $1.75 a share. That will be down from this year -- the company expects revenue of $3 billion to $3.1 billion and earnings of $2.05 to $2.30 a share.The 2017 forecast is very different from the numbers Widmar announced a year ago. In November 2016 he introduced a major strategic shift, killing plans to roll out a new panel this year to go straight to the Series 6. That move led to more than $700 million in charges for the fourth quarter of last year and he predicted a loss of as much as 80 cents a share for this year.??The company is in the best position ever in its history,?? Widmar said. ??Our Series 4 is the lowest cost panel in production and Series 6 will be better than that. I'm thrilled that there's still demand for it.?? With assistance by Brian Eckhouse"

The five-day hearing will start on June 25, she said.The London fight over the company's right to pickup passengers is one of many legal battles Uber faces in Europe. On Wednesday, the European Union's top court will issue a closely-watched ruling on whether Uber should be considered a taxi company or a digital app provider for regulatory purposes.GMB will be allowed to make submissions on issues surrounding the health and safety of Uber's drivers, where the company's business model ""encourages and incentivises drivers to work excessive hours, putting public safety at serious risk,"" lawyers for the union said.LTDA's role in the appeal will be more clearly defined once TfL has decided on the scope of its arguments ahead of the trial. But the group, which represents drivers of London's iconic black cabs, can't argue that Uber's operating model is illegal, Arbuthnot said.A spokesman for Uber declined to comment after the decision. The unions didn't immediately respond to requests to comment.The decision leaves more than six months for the transport regulator and Uber to reach an agreement on the license to operate -- a resolution both sides have expressed a desire to reach.The appeal will have important implications for Uber's business. London is the company's largest market outside the U.S., and a loss of its license or change to its labor rules could hurt attempts by the company, which is losing billions of dollars a year, to become profitable."

Regulatory Overkill Is Driving Biggest Canada Homebuilder South,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/regulatory-overkill-is-driving-biggest-canada-homebuilder-south,"December 19, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",technology,"""Mattamy Homes will expand over half its business to U.S."", ""Ontario land availability scarce; U.S. pricing cheaper: CEO""","Mattamy Homes Ltd., North-America's largest private residential homebuilder, is boosting investments in the U.S. as regulatory excess sends land prices -- and frustration -- skyrocketing in Ontario, chief executive officer Peter Gilgan said.Mattamy expects to generate more than half its business from the U.S. in the next five years, including the southern states of Arizona, California and Florida, up from about one-third now, Gilgan said in an interview at Bloomberg's Toronto office. The Toronto-based company posted annual revenue of C$3.2 billion ($2.5 billion) for its fiscal year ended in May.A push to curb urban sprawl has pinched supply and helped send Toronto-area land prices soaring, developers say. The cost has almost tripled in some areas over the past five years, according to real-estate advisory Altus Group Ltd. Development consultants Malone Given Parsons Ltd. says zoning restrictions limit space for residential construction to only 17,200 hectares (42,500 acres), much less than the 100,000 hectares the province says is available.??It's complete fabrication as to how much land is available,?? Gilgan, 67, said. ??If you can find all that land that you say is available at an affordable price, bring it to me today and I'll get my checkbook out. Nobody's brought me an acre.??The time it takes to get through the development process is also becoming untenable, he said, citing the company's Downsview Park project north of the city. In the past, the city would require maybe two detailed plans for development that would include engineering designs for things like sewers and gas lines, he said.For Downsview, that extended to about 40, said Gilgan. ??They seem to consider it a good week if they can say ??No' 100 times. That's not the reason we're going to the U.S. but it does give you continual insight into how things can be.??The province has identified opportunities to streamline its residential-approval process to bring housing to market faster, according to Praveen Senthinathan, spokesman for the Ministry of Municipal Affairs. And it has enough serviced land to meet provincial requirements for three years supply of residential units, Senthinathan said in an email. Gregg Lintern, acting chief planner for the City of Toronto, said in an email that?development proposals that align with city regulations move more quickly.As part of its drive south, Mattamy recently acquired closely held Royal Oaks Building Group in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.Gilgan said property in markets such as Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas might cost $40,000 to $60,000 compared with C$6 million ($4.7 million) in Toronto, including land, development fees plus charges to carry the land through a lengthy and convoluted process. ??You'll likely get the entitlements you'll need in three years instead of seven,?? he said.While many of the big U.S. residential developers such as Lennar Corp. and DR Horton Inc. are listed on U.S. stock exchanges, Gilgan said he has no plans to take Mattamy public.?The CEO has a net worth of at least $1.9 billion, according to calculations by Bloomberg. He said his company makes long-term investments that don't fare well with short-term quarterly reporting focused on the number of units built.??Homebuilding is more suited to public debt and private equity,?? Gilgan said. Mattamy has about C$1.8 billion in debt and will continue to borrow in the capital markets.Despite new rules such as mortgage stress tests and a foreign buyers tax that have tempered Toronto's housing market -- a good thing according to Gilgan -- demand for new homes is still high amid a buoyant economy, he said.The struggle lies in producing houses that residents can afford. While Mattamy surveys show that people still want their ??patch of grass?? the company will continue to expand in multi-story residential buildings.

U.K. Lawmakers Call Twitter's Brexit Response ??Inadequate',https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/u-k-lawmakers-call-twitter-s-brexit-response-inadequate,"December 14, 2017, 10:18 AM EST",politics,"""Culture Committee calls on Twitter for more data on campaign"", ""Collins wants more detail on Russian involvement in the vote""","U.K. lawmakers have called on Twitter Inc. to provide more information on accounts that may have influenced the 2016 campaign to leave the European Union, after an original response by the company was branded ??inadequate.??The Chairman of Parliament's Culture Media and Sport Committee, Damian Collins, released a letter Thursday to Twitter's Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey demanding the company respond by Jan. 15 to queries about research by City University, London, concerning some 13,500 suspected automated accounts, or bots.?Collins said a letter Twitter released Wednesday about Russian involvement in the vote didn't sufficiently answer the questions he'd posed. That letter was sent to the Electoral Commission, Britain's elections watchdog, which is carrying out its own investigation into whether the campaign to leave the EU?broke spending laws.?In it, Twitter revealed RT, an account run by the state-funded broadcaster RT, formerly known as Russia Today, spent $1,031.99 on six advertisements related to the campaign. Collins said his committee's inquiry has a wider remit.Twitter spokesman Ian Plunkett declined to comment on Collins' criticism. But in its letter to Collins' committee Twitter said its review of suspect activity around the EU referendum vote is continuing and that it would provide Collins' committee with updates if it identified additional information.Marco Bastos, a lecturer in media and communications at City University who co-authored the study of Twitter activity around the EU referendum, said he shared lawmakers' concerns about lack of transparency from Twitter and Facebook on the issue of Russian interference.He said while his own study was able to identify suspicious accounts that seemed to be part of a botnet -- a group of fake accounts controlled by a single entity and programmed to automatically tweet certain messages - the researchers did not have enough data to determine who was controlling this activity.Bastos said Twitter itself, however, ought to have enough metadata -- information such as the IP addresses being used by these accounts, the times of the day they were active, and what other accounts they were linked to -- to get a much clearer picture of the scope of the botnet and who might have been controlling it. He cautioned, however, that sifting through this meta-data was an arduous task, requiring a lot of manual examination of accounts and metadata.Facebook Inc. has also tried to dismiss concerns of Russian meddling in the Brexit vote. Collins on Wednesday attacked the social media giant for failing to address his questions about possible Russian interference in the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union and the June election.In a letter to the committee released Wednesday, Facebook said the Internet Research Agency -- an entity that U.S. intelligence agencies have identified as part of a Russian-led effort to sway the U.S. presidential election -- only spent 97 cents on ads targeting U.K. audiences in the lead-up to the referendum. The money purchased three ads that were seen by about 200 people over four days in May 2016, according to the letter.Collins said that Facebook should have conducted a more thorough investigation, going beyond just one known Russian-linked entity."

Chairman Michael Pellini to join him at Section 32.The addition of Pellini as a managing partner means the San Diego-based firm launched earlier this year can increase its investing pace and tap his health-care experience as an executive at Foundation, a genomic diagnostics company; cancer testing firm Clarient Inc.; and the company now known as PLUS Diagnostics.??I like technology, but I'm not enamored with it,?? Pellini said. ??I'm enamored with figuring out how to fit it into routine clinical practice.??Pellini's addition is surprising given Maris's background in health investing and his previously stated commitments to back a range of technologies and hire a female partner.Although Maris acknowledged the industry has a power imbalance -- 93 percent of venture capitalists with the ability to invest are men -- he said quotas are a poor method to achieve parity.Maris said he'd spoken to more than 100 potential candidates before selecting Pellini, who he has known since 2011 when Google Ventures first saw a funding pitch from Foundation. When a mutual friend pointed out the two lived about 30 minutes from each other in southern California, they began talking about working together at Section 32, Pellini said.Maris, who founded and ran Alphabet Inc.'s venture arm GV until leaving last year to launch his own firm, said he has backed 17 startups so far and still has ample cash left in the fund, which he said closed at $160 million.One of those startups is undisclosed. Of the 16 companies Section 32 lists as having backed, all but one are led by men, according to information on each of their websites and elsewhere online. Arsanis Inc., a company developing treatments for infections, is run by Rene Russo.The others include digital currency startup Coinbase; food company Northern Quinoa Production Corp., health startup Auris Surgical Robotics; and Embark, which does DNA testing of dogs."

Bryan Smith, chief executive officer of the Toronto-based company, said. It took less than the government's target of 10 business days to process the recruit's application. Previously it could take several months. ??If the government says two weeks and it actually is, that will create a whole new process around it.??As President Donald Trump moves to crack down on the immigration of high-tech workers to the U.S., Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's new Global Skills Strategy is taking off.

Canada's Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said in a phone interview. ??This program came from the business community. They identified a challenge and said you need to fix it.??Those who are fast-tracked can apply to stay as long as three years and also for permanent residency. Computer programmers, systems analysts, and software engineers, are the top three categories of workers to benefit so far.

There are several regulatory and legislative efforts underway in the U.S. to reduce abuse in the program and the number of applications being challenged has jumped. Applications to the annual lottery for visas dropped this year for the first time in five years, reflecting concerns about a more restrictive approach, though applications still far exceed the 85,000 visas available through the lottery.To those who have watched Canada hemorrhage talent to the U.S. over the years, the tables may be turning.??We've seen a spike in talent coming from south to north for our companies,?? says Yung Wu, CEO at tech incubator MaRS Discovery District. ??They are reporting 30 to 40 percent of their applicants coming from down south.??Canada's fast-track visa program is just one part of Trudeau's drive to boost innovation. The government is also pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into venture capital and support for artificial intelligence, joining private money investing in the country's tech hubs in Waterloo and Toronto, Ontario, Vancouver and Montreal.Two thousand people may be a small sliver when compared with the 320,000 newcomers Canada welcomed last year.""It sounds like a drop in the bucket,"" says Daniel Mandelbaum of immigration firm Mamann Sandaluk & Kingwell LLP.

Enders, who turns 59 on Dec. 21, has warned the probe may lead to ??significant penalties?? and is trying to convince investigators in France and the U.K. that Airbus is serious about cleaning house as it works to get past the controversy.Airbus can't afford to let the succession drag. As well as contending with the corruption claims, the Toulouse, France-based company is pondering whether to scrap its flagship A380 superjumbo model amid sluggish demand. Germany and France are major investors in the planemaker, and the top two jobs normally rotate between nationals of the two countries.Airbus declined to comment on succession matters. The company is due to hold its annual investor meeting in April after reporting full-year earnings on Feb. 15, when it may provide an update on the bribery claims. Kepler Cheuvreux said Wednesday that its target price for the stock assumes a?penalty provision of 2.5 billion euros ($3 billion).Bregier, who heads the commercial planes division, was told earlier this year that he wouldn't get the top job and has been looking for other opportunities since, according to people familiar with the matter. The 56-year-old Frenchman and had been the favorite to replace the German Enders. However, Bregier oversees one of the businesses that's been caught up in the probes of alleged corruption related to the use of middlemen in aircraft sales.Enders rose through the ranks at Airbus and was appointed chief after previously running the commercial planemaking unit -- the usual springboard to the top job. His record as CEO has been mixed.Airbus has already seen a partial overhaul of its senior management ranks. Marwan Lahoud, its head of strategy, departed last year, while John Leahy, the head of sales and a fixture at the company for decades, announced his decision to retire a few weeks ago.

How a 77-Year-Old Singapore CEO Fixed a S$100 Million Blunder,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/how-apple-helped-a-77-year-old-ceo-recover-from-his-worst-error,"December 19, 2017, 11:00 AM EST",technology,"""Hi-P had first loss as a customer didn't take product delivery"", ""Yao led a turnaround; stock has more than tripled this year""","In 2015, Yao Hsiao Tung was 75 and looking to slow down. He'd begun seeking his successor as chief executive officer of Hi-P International Ltd., a contract manufacturer for customers including Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. But an annual loss, and the $126 million claim that Hi-P filed because of it, ended that plan.The self-professed troubleshooter attributes the company's first red ink since listing on Singapore's stock exchange mostly to one big error that he oversaw. Its electronics unit took on a contract to co-design and produce a dual-screen smartphone for Yota Devices Ltd. without doing enough due diligence. The Moscow-based firm didn't take delivery of the phones, according to Yao. Yota couldn't be reached for comment.Two years -- and, according to Hi-P, about S$100 million ($74 million) in losses -- later, the company is heading for its largest annual profit on record, helped by its work for Apple. Its shares have more than tripled in 2017, which is by far the biggest gain on the FTSE Straits Times All Share Index.??We took unnecessary risk,?? Yao said in an interview in Singapore. ??But I believed I could turn the situation around.??Yao says he secured financing from lenders including Singapore's United Overseas Bank Ltd. Then he changed the company's structure, creating four business units in order to target a more diversified client base and be less reliant on individual customers. He increased the company's focus on employee incentives and also developed a system to evaluate and limit exposure to counterparty risk.Finally, he started arbitration proceedings against Yota to reclaim some of the losses. They were settled this year for $17 million and an agreement that Hi-P could sell its remaining inventory of the phone that it made for the Russian company, while keeping the proceeds.Those efforts, coupled with Hi-P's relationship with the thriving Apple, have led to a recovery. Yao's company posted a S$54.5 million profit in 2016, and is expected to almost double that this year, according to estimates by DBS Group Holdings Ltd. Hi-P manufactures components of the iPhone including the SIM card tray and volume-control buttons, the company said.An employee looks through a microscope to inspect products at the company's production facility in Singapore.As a rare Singapore-listed company on Apple's official list of its top 200 suppliers published in February, Hi-P has benefited from three new iPhone launches this year. Apple expects to post record revenue of as much as $87 billion in the quarter ending late December, driven by the 10-year anniversary iPhone, as well as resurgent iPad and Mac sales, the U.S. technology giant said in November.??Hi-P is in a sweet spot now,?? Ling Lee Keng, a DBS analyst, wrote in a November report. More than half of the company's earnings are derived from the smartphone, internet-of-things and smart-home businesses, which are expected to continue to do well in the next two years, she said.Products move along an automated line.Given the company's strong earnings, Yao says he's considering acquisitions in the automotive and health-care industries. He declined to identify targets but said he has a ??big dream?? and a way to achieve it.Yao, who owns 83 percent of Hi-P, has seen the value of his shareholding surge to $888 million. He was born in China but moved to Taiwan when he was five, and only arrived in Singapore at 39, when he was transferred there by DuPont, his employer at the time. He started to learn English ??seriously?? shortly after that.The 77-year-old says he has a fighting spirit -- principled, but ??very aggressive?? -- that was born from poverty in childhood and the relocations of his life. Everywhere you go, kids bully the newcomer, he said. ??Although I was small, I became a strong fighter,?? he said.Yao left DuPont in 1983 and took over the management of Hi-P. It had been founded in 1980 with Yao as a silent partner. The company, which started out making insert molding and metal tools in China and selling them in Singapore, almost went out of business during the worldwide recession of the 1980s. It flourished thereafter, listing on the Singapore Exchange in 2003. Today, it has about 15,000 employees and a market value of more than $1 billion.Yao Hsiao Tung??He's always proved the market wrong,?? said Jarick Seet, head of small and mid-cap research at RHB Research Institute Singapore Pte.???When everyone thought he was going to fail, he came back.??Still, Seet cautioned that Hi-P is too dependent on Apple. He estimates that at least half of revenue comes from the U.S. company. Hi-P has worked with Apple since 2009, starting with the iPod, according to the Singapore-listed company.??The key thing that is profitable for them is still mobile phones,?? Seet said. ??They're diversifying, but it's still slow.??While Hi-P's 243 percent advance this year is more than 13 times that of Singapore's Straits Times Index, it's still cheaper than the average company in the 30-member gauge. Hi-P trades at about 12 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, compared to 14 times for the benchmark gauge. The company's shares fell 1.1 percent to close at S$1.75 in Singapore on Wednesday.With the business stabilized, Yao has begun planning for succession again. He appointed Yong Inn Nam as chief operating officer in November. Yong had been responsible for developing business with clients other than Apple, in another sign of Yao's attempts to diversify. In a statement to the exchange, Yao said that the company's leadership for the next generation is also being identified.??I don't have an intention to leave the company to family,?? Yao said. ??I don't have kids also. But what I want to leave is a legacy.??"
VC Pishevar Accused of Misconduct by Another Entrepreneur,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-07/another-female-entrepreneur-alleges-misconduct-by-vc-pishevar,"December 7, 2017, 3:18 PM EST",technology,,"Another woman came forward with a claim of sexual harassment by Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist who's on leave from his firms after allegations involving six other women. Laura Fitton, an author and entrepreneur, is the first to speak publicly since a Bloomberg report last week and agree to be named making allegations against the litigious investor.Fitton said Pishevar misled her into being alone with him in an elevator in December 2011 after a charity event at a hotel in New York. She said he aggressively kissed her and that she pushed him away. Fitton said she followed him to his room expecting a party but found herself alone. Pishevar repeatedly made unwanted advances, and she tried to appease him briefly, not wanting to alienate a powerful business connection, she said. She eventually fled the room.??Mr. Pishevar unequivocally and categorically denies any improper behavior toward Ms. Fitton,?? Randa Osman, Pishevar's attorney at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, wrote in an emailed statement. Osman referenced 10 correspondences between Pishevar and Fitton afterward, including one in 2015 when Fitton apologized for her ??brittle response?? after the alleged incident four years earlier and called him ??very, very special.??Bloomberg reported last week on the accounts of multiple women who say Pishevar used his business or political sway to make unwanted sexual advances. He denied those allegations and said he ??will be vindicated?? in court. Axios first reported on Fitton's claims Thursday, and Bloomberg spoke to her independently.Fitton said she apologized years later and tried to maintain a relationship with Pishevar because she relied on his connections for her businesses and believed her experience was an isolated event. She's the author of ??Twitter for Dummies?? and creator of an app store for Twitter that was acquired by a marketing firm, where she helps organize conferences with high-profile speakers from the technology industry.Unlike in Hollywood or Washington, where alleged harassers are quickly disavowed, the reaction from prominent figures in Silicon Valley has been more muted. ??His denials are why I'm coming forward,?? Fitton said. ??After the deafening silence of the industry and his continued denials, I've come back around. They truly hurt to read.??Last month, Pishevar, an early backer of Uber Technologies Inc., sued a corporate research firm, Definers Public Affairs, claiming it was retained by ??business adversaries?? to orchestrate a smear campaign to plant false and damaging gossip. Definers, founded by Republican campaign veterans, said it has nothing to do with the accusations and asked a judge to dismiss Pishevar's complaint.In Definers' court filing, the firm also said Pishevar ??used this suit to harass and intimidate one woman whom the press has named as one of his alleged victims by serving her with a subpoena to depose her.?? Bloomberg's story last week included alleged incidents involving Uber executive Austin Geidt, conveyed by her current and former colleagues. After the report, Pishevar's lawyers asked Geidt to testify, people with knowledge of the matter said. Geidt declined to comment.Pishevar, 43, said this week he is taking a leave from the venture capital and transportation firms he co-founded. The Iranian-American is one of several technology investors who have been accused of sexual misconduct this year, including Dave McClure, a venture capitalist at 500 Startups, and Steve Jurvetson, another venture capitalist.Such disclosures have forced Silicon Valley, and other industries, especially in entertainment, to come to terms with issues of gender inequality and sexual misconduct by powerful men. A study published Wednesday by venture firm First Round Capital, showed that half of technology entrepreneurs have either been harassed in the workplace or know somebody who has.Pishevar was a partner at Menlo Ventures at the time he allegedly harassed Fitton. Menlo Ventures said in a Twitter post that it wasn't aware of any misconduct claims during Pishevar's tenure until Thursday. ??We are saddened to hear the stories of the women who have come forward and are thankful for their bravery,?? the venture capital firm wrote. ??Menlo Ventures strongly condemns any inappropriate or disrespectful behavior toward women, in and out of the workplace.??Fitton said after she and Pishevar reached his hotel room that night, she awkwardly fended off his advances while she waited for others to join them and for food to arrive. ??My mind was racing the entire time we were in that room together, trying to find a way out of the situation that did not lead to him feeling rejected and angry and therefore cutting me off as a professional colleague,?? she said.In the following days, Fitton said she confronted Pishevar over the phone and told him his behavior was inappropriate for an investor interacting with an entrepreneur. He explained he thought they had a special connection, according to Fitton. She said they had barely talked the entire evening and insisted it was an abuse of power. Pishevar apologized and offered to help her career in the future, she said. ??I can get you a job anywhere,?? she recalled him saying.Pishevar followed up with a text Fitton shared with Bloomberg, where he wrote: ??Just want to say thank you for being real with me. I deeply appreciate that. Let's grab a proper breakfast or lunch and share inspiration and advice together. You're an awesome person.??"

More than 100 news outlets also published stories containing those handles in the run-up to the election, and some of them were even tweeted by a top?presidential aide. These news imposter accounts, which are part of the 2,752 now-suspended accounts that Twitter Inc.?has publicly disclosed to be tied to the IRA, show how the Russian group sought to build local communities of followers to disseminate messages. Many of the news imposter accounts amassed their following by tweeting headlines from real news sites, while others sought to represent certain communities. They targeted a diverse set of regions?across the political spectrum, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco and Boston.?Several of the accounts were impersonating local news outlets in swing states, like @TodayPittsburgh, @TodayMiami and @TodayCincinnati.There were about 40 news imposter accounts out of the 2,752 Twitter accounts that the company identified as being tied to the IRA. Twitter has deactivated all of those accounts and removed any data on the accounts from third-party sources. Information on the details of the accounts was gathered from?Meltwater, a data intelligence firm that monitors social media. Details on the contents of the tweets are from Facebook?posts that were synced with the users' Twitter accounts. Some of the followers of the accounts could be bots, and the same bots or users could have followed multiple imposter accounts.Twitter did not verify any of the 2,752 accounts, according to a company spokeswoman. Twitter says it&apos;s taking steps to stop malicious actors on its platform.""We take seriously reports that the power of our service was misused by a foreign actor for the purpose of influencing the U.S. presidential election and undermining public faith in the democratic process,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""Twitter believes that any activity of that kind??regardless of magnitude??is intolerable, and we agree that we must do better to prevent it.""?Weslie Viddaurri is one of the people who followed one of these fake news accounts, @TodayNYCity. He had no idea it was linked to the Russian-based troll farm. The account had more than 60,000 followers and claimed to be ""New York City&apos;s local news on Twitter. Breaking news, sports, events and international news."" Many of the account&apos;s tweets linked to breaking news stories from legitimate local news sites, like the New York Daily News and the New York Times.Viddaurri signed up for Twitter three years go. He lives in the small town of Spavinaw, Oklahoma, where he&apos;s a machinist at a company that makes airplanes. He used to check Twitter almost every day to read the news, until he decided to quit last month (though he didn&apos;t delete his account). Twitter recently revealed that more than 36,000 Russian-linked accounts generated about 1.4 million automated, election-related Tweets. Viddaurri says the recent revelations have turned him away from Twitter.?""I assumed that there was more real people and real stuff on social media than there really is. It&apos;s just so fake. It has been disheartening. I wish Twitter had been more vigilant on vetting people that become members,"" said Viddaurri, who is 50. ""I don&apos;t trust Twitter news anymore.""Viddaurri followed almost 4,500 Twitter accounts. He followed news sites, public figures and politicians on all sides of the political spectrum. Bloomberg LP is developing a global breaking news network for the Twitter service.Lawmakers berated social media companies for taking too long to recognize the seriousness of manipulation. People tied to the Russian government used Facebook, Google and Twitter to spread content crafted to sow social discord in America. By operating fake news accounts targeted toward certain regions, the IRA was able to amass followers in specific populations and push messages to them.?@BlackNewsOutlet, one of the fake accounts, had more than 40,000 followers and had a description of ""Freedom is never given; it is won. #BlackLivesMatter."" Tweets from this account frequently posted news about social unrest or headlines to incite anger.?A retweeted post from @BlackNewsOutlet on Oct. 19, 2016 read: ""How many more black lives needed to change the rotten police systems?""The accounts amassed influential followers. Sebastian?Gorka, a former deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, had retweeted several posts from @tpartynews, one of the Kremlin-linked accounts that had more than 20,000 followers. At the end?of 2016 Gorka retweeted a post from @tpartynews that read:???The era of?the pajama boy is over January 20th and?the alpha males are back.?? The post refers to one of Gorka's catchphrases.???Pajama Boy?? refers to a meme that advocated for the legislative agenda of Barack Obama. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20.?There were both left-leaning and right-leaning accounts. One of them, @redlanews, which had almost 10,000 followers, said its author was???Red Louisiana News??, with a biography that read: ??Conservative; Right and proud; Christian. Love my country and will stand against liberals and socialists.?? The account tweeted news from outlets like Breitbart and wrote incendiary posts before the election. One of them read: ??Hillary Clinton believes in white supremacy. The only racist here it&apos;s her Corrupt lying politician?#HillarysEmails.?? Another tweet from the account in early 2016 tagged Trump in the post: ""@realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz will destroy our economy and military might with his plans. The only way to fight islamists is Trump way!????The @MissouriNewsUS account, which had almost 6,000 followers, had a description of one hashtag: #NeverHilary. Another handle, @NewYorkDem, said it was for???New York, uniting Liberals since 1624!""From the beginning of 2016 until Election Day,?Tweets from those accounts were cited by more than 100 news organizations. One month after the election, the Washington Post included an embedded tweet from @ChicagoDailyNew.The opinionated news accounts like @redlanews and @tpartynews followed a similar strategy to the @Ten_GOP account linked to the IRA, which posed as a group for Tennessee Republicans. It had over 100,000 followers, was retweeted by some of Trump&apos;s aides, and posed as a patriotic American. It overtly lauded Trump while attacking Hillary Clinton. This account was a focus of the House Intelligence Committee during the November hearings on social media companies. Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, asked Twitter to give a complete catalog of tweets that came from the pro-Trump @Ten_GOP account.?It&apos;s hard for researchers to know why?the news imposter accounts were created, since the full history of tweets is gone. Researchers have concluded that many of the IRA-linked accounts were created to sow social discord, by trying to ""put left-wing people further to the left and right-wing people further to the right,"" said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Digital Forensic Research Lab. ""It&apos;s that attempt to amplify the differences in society.""Researchers say another purpose of the accounts was to establish them as trusted news sources, and then activate them later to spread propaganda and disinformation. Troll factories have taken that approach before. During the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, Nimmo observed various online forums and platforms linked to Russian troll factories that would ingratiate themselves in the pro-Ukrainian community by posting favorable information. Then after gaining credibility, those sites would shift their tone to write stories that expressed discontent with Ukraine.In fact, Nimmo says these news imposter accounts may have been created for an operation that never happened. A U.S. intelligence report concluded that the Russian government was expecting Hillary Clinton to win the election and were prepared to call into question the validity of the results. Pro-Kremlin bloggers had prepared a Twitter campaign, #DemocracyRIP on election night in anticipation of her victory, according to the report. These news imposter accounts could have aided those efforts to undermine the election results by promoting certain hashtags and topics like ??voter fraud?? or ??rigged election."" ?By?having a network of local news accounts across the country, the?Kremlin would be able to distribute propaganda at scale that could galvanize local populations to protest, according to Nimmo. A Russian-linked Facebook group attempted to organize anti-immigrant and anti-Hillary Clinton protests in Texas shortly before the November elections.The majority of the imposter news accounts were created more than a year before the 2016 U.S. elections. The history of tweets and engagement with real users improves the placement of the account and its posts in Twitter&apos;s search results, according to Kris Shaffer, a data scientist doing research for University of Mary Washington and the Data for Democracy. That means that if the account does push major disinformation campaigns, it is less likely to be blocked.Shaffer&apos;s analysis of the accounts found that several of the imposter news accounts also tweeted during the French presidential election. He surfaced about 41 Tweets from accounts including @WorldNewsPoli, @TodayMiami, @DetroitDailyNew, and @ChicagoDailyNew. Most of the posts were retweets of local news articles, but more than a quarter of them included stories from truthfeed.com, a known disinformation site, according to Shaffer. Those stories were mostly attacking Emmanuel Macron, who won the election, and biased toward Marine Le Pen, a far-right politician in France.After the revelations of Russian influence, Viddaurri said he no longer knows what to believe online. With Twitter out of his regular routine, he only checks Facebook occasionally to stay in touch with friends and family. ??Thanks to the whole election of 2016, social media got ruined,?? Viddaurri said."
Attention Elon Musk: A Japanese Robot Maker is Staging Publicity Stunt Outside SpaceX,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/attention-elon-musk-a-japanese-robot-maker-is-staging-publicity-stunt-outside-spacex,"December 4, 2017, 4:19 AM EST",technology,,"Employees arriving for work at SpaceX's Los Angeles headquarters will be greeted by a mysterious billboard on Monday.??Dear Elon, our ambition is mashi-mashi as yours. ??LOVE X ROBOT = LOVOT' From another X in Tokyo.?? (Mashi-mashi is Japanese slang for super-sized?toppings in ramen shops.)Groove X Inc., a Tokyo-based startup developing robots with emotional rather than utilitarian skills, is behind the marketing stunt aimed at Elon?Musk, founder of Space Exploration Technologies Corp.??First, we would like him to know that we exist,?? said Kaname Hayashi, who started Groove X with the goal of building and selling robots that can serve as a buddy, like R2-D2, or Japan's Doraemon. ??We would also like people to imagine a future where we share our lives with robots, and especially what it will be like for people on Mars. Chances are, there is no living well without some kind of robots when we get to Mars.??Groove X's caper aims to capitalize on SpaceX and Musk's fame, and coincides with a plan?unveiled earlier on Monday to raise as much as 6.45 billion yen ($57 million) from investors including Sparx Group Co. and state-backed Innovation Network Corp. of Japan.While most of the world's 1.8 million robots can be found on factory assembly lines, Groove X thinks there will be just as much market potential for a robot that can be an emotional companion. So far, attempts to use machines as a human-like partner, such as SoftBank Group Corp.'s talking Pepper, haven't met with much success. Hayashi, a former Formula One engineer at Toyota Motor Corp., was hired by?SoftBank's Masayoshi Son in 2012 to lead Pepper's development. He left in 2015 to found Groove X.Hayashi is keeping the details of his gadget under wraps, and promises to unveil it?in late 2018. The machine will be larger than Sony Corp.'s Aibo, but smaller than Pepper, Hayashi said. He's?tight-lipped about what Groove X's robot?will actually do, saying only that it will appeal to people stressed out by modern life. And it will do so without talking.Linguistically, Groove X's publicity stunt might be hard to parse. ?The term mashi-mashi?is probably a nod to a picture that Musk tweeted in 2014 of a Ramen Jiro shop, which popularized the phrase.???Lovot?? works better in Japanese because the ??b?? and ??v?? sounds are almost indistinguishable.??Language is a double-edged sword,?? Hayashi said. ??When it comes to healing, words are not always necessary.??For more on Elon Musk, check out the Decrypted? podcast:?"
"Puerto Rico Suffers From ??Hypocritical' Tax Bill, Officials Say",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/puerto-rico-suffers-from-hypocritical-tax-bill-officials-say,"December 18, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",politics,"""Rossello promises that the plan's supporters will be singed"", ""Measure raises the cost of manufacturing on stricken island""","The Republican tax plan will erode the foundation of Puerto Rico's most important industry and politicians who support it will pay a price at the polls, local officials said over the weekend.A new levy aimed at companies' income from intellectual property that's held in offshore tax havens will also hit the bankrupt, storm-ravaged commonwealth, making it more expensive for pharmaceutical companies to manufacture their drugs there. Drug and medical-device makers have poured billions into the U.S. territory, creating thousands of jobs and driving almost a third of its economic output.??This will be disastrous for Puerto Rico,?? commonwealth Senator Jose Nadal said after the latest version of the bill was released. The measure, which includes large permanent tax cuts for companies and temporary relief for the middle class, is set to go to a vote this week.The U.S. territory has long relied on preferential tax treatment to lure lucrative manufacturing jobs in the pharmaceutical and electronics sectors. But the changes could dissuade others from coming and even prompt companies to leave. And the months-long blackout cause by Hurricane Maria exposed the risks of production on a vulnerable Caribbean island.Is Puerto Rico Part of U.S.? That's Complicated: QuickTake Q&AIt's hard to imagine how bankrupt Puerto Rico's economy could get worse. It was already withering after a decade of economic contraction and this year declared a record $74 billion bankruptcy. A federal financial overnight board is auditing its bank accounts. Then, the devastating Sept. 20 natural disaster left hundreds of thousands without electricity and business -- and, in much of the commonwealth, modern life -- ground to a halt.??We live in a stagnant economy in which none of the mechanisms implemented have been able to stimulate growth,"" Omar Rodriguez, a lawyer, said as he visited La Placita square in San Juan's Santurce district on Sunday. ??Under the current circumstances, the little progress we had achieved will be reversed by the federal government????In the end, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico never receives the same benefits as the other 50 states.""?The new tax rate on intellectual property wasn't immediately clear. An explanation appended to the text of the bill implied it would be 10.5 percent; Governor Ricardo Rossello and Puerto Rico economist Gustavo Velez said it would be 12.5 percent, as proposed in the Senate's version of the final bill.Ricardo RosselloRossello promised there would be consequences for lawmakers who support the bill. The Puerto Rican diaspora makes up a growing part of the electorate in in Florida, a crucial swing state, as well as New York and New Jersey. Since the storm, more than 247,000 have left the island of 3.4 million for Florida alone; the commonwealth's population already had shrunk about 10 percent in the past decade.Rossello on Friday said politicians flocked to Puerto Rico after the hurricane with pledges of support that he said now appear insincere. (He didn't name them, but Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin both took to the dais with similar promises after Hurricane Maria.) He said congressional leadership was being ??hypocritical.????If they do this, you know what? Next year are the mid-term elections, and many of those representatives and senators have Hispanics, have Puerto Ricans in their districts and states,"" Rossello said. ""We're going to be involved.""Not everyone saw apocalypse ahead. The island seemed to have dodged the worst-case scenario -- a 20 percent excise tax that was proposed on imports and would have affected Puerto Rican products.Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's non-voting member of the U.S. House of Representatives and a supporter of Republicans, said in Washington that pro-business measures were forthcoming as part of a new supplemental disaster relief bill to protect jobs. She and House Speaker Paul Ryan had said last month in a joint release that the island's concerns would be addressed in the tax bill.Despite officials' fears, no drugmaker has yet said it would leave the island due to the tax changes, and companies would pay the same offshore tax on operations in other countries. However, Puerto Rico has said it could be less competitive because island manufacturing sites there have to comply with federal environmental and labor regulations, even though considered foreign for tax purposes.But uncertainty and confusion could be enough to turn people away.??All planning related to Puerto Rico essentially has changed,?? said Gabriel Hernandez, head of the tax division at BDO Puerto Rico, a San Juan financial adviser."

SpaceX completed a static fire test for the mission on the refurbished pad Wednesday and will use it again in early January for its classified Zuma mission, the company said in a Tweet.While Space Launch Complex 40 was being repaired, SpaceX moved its Falcon 9 launches to the historic 39A pad at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where Neil Armstrong left from before landing on the moon in 1969. Now that the pad is fixed, SpaceX can resume launching its smaller Falcon 9 there while preparing Pad 39A for the upcoming maiden flight of its larger Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX also uses a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.The closely held company, based in Hawthorne, California, has already flown 16 missions in 2017, double its number in 2016, and it's targeting about 30 next year. CRS-13 will use both a pre-flown rocket booster and a reused spacecraft, the company said in a separate Tweet."

The final version lets companies offset as much as 80 percent of?their foreign transaction tax with renewable energy credits.??People concerned about those credits will be happy,?? Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio said in an interview Friday. ??It's a high enough percentage to keep the credits, but not too high to have people pay zero taxes.??This arrangement, known as tax equity financing, is a critical funding source for clean energy. The two biggest U.S. solar companies,?First Solar Inc.?and SunPower Corp., are trying to close on project financing by the end of the year from large financial companies interested in using tax credits from the proposed solar farms, said?Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Without the 11th-hour compromise, the?minimum tax on foreign transactions -- called the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, or BEAT -- would make that harder.Any deal allowing wind and solar credits to offset upward?of 80 percent of the minimum?foreign?transactions tax would preserve clean energy credits as a financing tool,?Liam Donovan, a tax lobbyist at Bracewell LLP, said in an email before the final text of the bill was released.??That would have to be considered a win,?? Donovan said.Solar stocks gained Friday,?with SunPower rising 4.2 percent at the close in New York. First Solar gained 1.6 percent, and Vivint Solar Inc. rose 5.3 percent.Major financial companies told groups including the American Council on Renewable Energy that they would no longer participate in tax-equity financing if the measure from the Senate bill had been adopted without being amended, Greg Wetstone, the Washington-based group's president, said in an email.??Almost overnight, you'd see a devastating reduction in wind and solar energy investment and development,?? Wetstone said.The jobs created by wind and solar in recent years played a key role in the compromise, said Senator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican.??There are tens of thousands of jobs on the line,?? Gardner said Thursday. ??If we get it right, it will continue to add to that opportunity to grow jobs in renewable energy and beyond -- and if not it will do harm to an industry that's just now really hitting its stride.??"

This has fueled capital spending, too, with Samsung announcing 20.4 trillion won ($19 billion) of new investments to expand output.?As the year comes to an end, South Korea's economy is set to expand more than 3 percent in 2017, its best performance since 2014. But because chip manufacturing is highly automated,?the export boom has created relatively few jobs -- about 1 percent of all new positions during the first six months of the year, according to Bank of Korea data.?""A sustained boom in the semiconductor industry leads to investment in production facilities, but with little increase in jobs,?? said Hong Jun-pyo, a research fellow at Hyundai Research Institute in Seoul. ""The industry's spillover effects in supporting domestic demand and raising overall wages are weak.""That has implications for policy makers at the BOK, according to the state-run Korea Development Institute. Because of a lack of clear improvement in the jobs market, and no strong inflationary pressures, it isn't yet time to shift to tighter monetary policy, the KDI said in a semiannual report released on Dec. 6. While the BOK raised the benchmark interest rate last month for the first time since 2011, it said policy remains accommodative.President Moon Jae-in was elected in May promising to become a ??jobs president?? and to help households earn more. While Korea's unemployment rate remains relatively low, at 3.6 percent in October, the government is worried about high youth joblessness, a lack of quality jobs and weak wage growth.Many remain bullish about the outlook for the semiconductor sector in medium term. The Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade forecasts that it will account for an even bigger share of exports next year -- 20 percent. Without semiconductors, the nation's exports would fall 1.8 percent next year, according to the think tank.Yet some say the semiconductor sector's dominance of Korea's economy poses a risk. Estimates of how long the chip cycle will run vary widely. Morgan Stanley sees it peaking ""soon,"" though Citigroup remains on the bullish side, saying the supply shortage should persist next year. In any case, the downturn in the sector will come eventually.??Korea's dependence on the semiconductor industry means that if chip prices face a correction, there is no industry to replace it as a growth engine,?? said Jeong Dae-hee, a research fellow at Korea Development Institute in Sejong, South Korea.??

UPS Warns of Temporary Delays After Cyber Monday Overwhelms Network,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/ups-warns-of-temporary-delays-as-cyber-monday-overwhelms-network,"December 5, 2017, 2:47 PM EST",technology,"""Shopping surge is crimping some package deliveries this week"", ""Courier says it's still on track to meet Christmas deadlines""","United Parcel Service Inc. is expecting slight delays in package deliveries through the middle of this week after a surge in e-commerce sales swamped its network in the days after Thanksgiving.Online orders on Cyber Monday and the days after overwhelmed expectations, UPS spokesman Steve Gaut said Tuesday, causing a ??bubble?? to develop at certain package centers. Heavy volumes forced one- or two-day delays for certain items ordered last week, even as the company worked over the weekend to catch up.Much of the backlog is already cleared, and UPS doesn't expect to miss Christmas deadlines because of it, Gaut said. The world's biggest package-delivery company has been preparing for months to handle the spike in shipments during the peak holiday season, implementing a 27-cent surcharge for the first time on packages sent to U.S. residences over certain weeks. UPS also expects to add 95,000 temporary workers.??The bubble has worked its way through the system, and we expect everything to be back in line with our forecasts by tomorrow,?? Gaut said.?UPS fell 2.7 percent to $120.37 at the close in New York, the biggest drop in four months. The shares have climbed 5 percent this year, trailing the 15 percent advance of a Standard & Poor's index of industrial stocks and?FedEx Corp.'s 26 percent gain.The shopping surge prompted the company to notify many of its drivers that they would be required to work as many as 70 hours over an eight-day spell, Gaut said.?Sixty hours over a seven-day period is more typical during peak season. Drivers are entitled to an extended rest following that period.The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said that UPS made that move without first consulting the local unions representing employees.??This is, after all, the third consecutive year in which Cyber Monday purchases have overwhelmed the company's capacity to deliver packages for the holidays,?? Teamsters General President James Hoffa wrote in a letter to UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney on Monday.UPS has implemented the temporary 70-hour workweek over eight days in the past, although it is using it more broadly around its network this year, Gaut said. News of the delays at Atlanta-based UPS was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.The courier's Express unit delivered 89 percent of packages by the end of the expected delivery day between Nov. 27 and Dec. 2, compared with an on-time rate of more than 99 percent at FedEx, according to ShipMatrix Inc., a data provider that tracks shippers' performance.UPS's Cyber Monday week performance was at least 95 percent in the previous four years, according to ShipMatrix. The survey only measures UPS's Express deliveries and does not measure its much larger Ground unit.Gaut declined to make any internal UPS on-time statistics available.UPS delivers almost double the volume of packages over peak season that FedEx does. UPS expects to deliver 750 million packages globally during peak season, compared with as many as 400 million at FedEx, according to each company's forecast.?FedEx alerted customers that Monday night storms at its airline hub in Memphis, Tennessee, disrupted sorting and flight operations and could delay some shipments Tuesday.??FedEx is proud of the outstanding service we've been able to provide during the first week of the peak holiday season,?? the company said by email.

The company is rolling out facial recognition, as in the iPhone X, to improve its customer experience -- read: get you into your car faster -- in a country where millennials are demanding better.The push, combined with a clean image, which has become in short supply in a nation plagued by scandals like the all-encompassing Carwash?corruption probe, has helped Localiza -- controlled by the same two families for some 44 years -- jump more than 1,700 percent since its 2005 initial public offering. The benchmark index rose 200 percent in that span.""Despite the commoditization of the industry, Localiza has invested a lot in technology and differentiated itself,"" said Marcos Silberman, an equity analyst at XP Investimentos's asset management unit. ""Management's also very competent, investing more in technology than others, and in marketing, and making it evident that renting a car is worthwhile.""Localiza,?based in Belo Horizonte, puts about 4 percent of revenue back into technology annually. That money has gone into revamping its website and mobile app, as well as improving its yield management. That allows it to know when to charge higher prices when and where demand is greatest.Chief Executive Officer Eugenio Mattar is optimistic that the investments will continue to push results. Rentals rose by 30 percent from the previous year so far in 2017, and used car sales for the company rose 38 percent in the third quarter as the Brazilian economy slowly emerges from its worst recession on record. The company's app has been downloaded more than half a million times, and it has about a third of the market share in Brazil, ahead of smaller competitors.""We should see strong growth as well next year,"" Mattar said in an interview at Bloomberg's Sao Paulo office. ""We are making a lot of changes to guarantee the loyalty of our clients and improve their experiences.""The stock fell 0.9 percent as of 3.34 p.m. local time Monday, trimming this year's gains to 93 percent.Still, the increase in ride-sharing also brings issues which Localiza is trying to solve, namely high default rates in cars leased to drivers?for apps like Uber, who tend to have poor credit.While it's considered buying its smaller rivals, nothing makes sense with high valuations and too many locations in common, Mattar said. Going abroad is also not on the agenda. Localiza's specialty is Brazil, and local, organic growth-potential is still great, he said. Economists surveyed by the Central Bank expect the economy to grow 0.9 percent this year and another 2.62 percent in 2018.The company is readying for what could be a volatile 2018 ahead of presidential elections. While a market-friendly candidate has yet to emerge, some investors are concerned about former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's lead in the polls, followed by firebrand ex-army captain Jair Bolsonaro. Localiza is keeping a conservative cash position, Mattar said.Despite the rally and one of the highest valuations among global peers, none of the 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg has a sell rating on the stock.""It's hard to prosper in this business,"" Mattar said, adding that the tech push makes them stand out among peers, allowing Localiza to tap into the demands of an impatient generation. ""There's a change in behavior starting with millennials. It's slow, but it's happening."""

Then Facebook Broke His Business,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/business-takes-a-hit-when-fake-news-baron-tries-to-play-it-straight,"December 12, 2017, 5:01 AM EST",technology,,"Cyrus Massoumi spent the last few years building exactly what he thought would thrive on Facebook: A series of inflammatory conservative websites, finely tuned to produce the most viral and outrageous version of the news. The social network rewarded him with an audience.These days, Facebook Inc. wants something different. Reacting to concerns about how fake news spread on its social network, including by Russian propagandists, the company has altered its algorithm to punish sites like Massoumi's. Facebook has put out a series of?blog posts?explaining how higher quality content will be rewarded.Massoumi, who's featured in the latest episode of the Decrypted podcast, said he had to decide between running ??a garbage website that is barely profitable after the fake news crisis?? and a ??clean website.?? He chose clean. In August, he shut down his biggest partisan website, MrConservative.com, and poured his resources into?TruthExaminer, a liberal website he launched just before the election. He made sure it played by Facebook's stricter rules, especially around clickbait -- headlines manipulated solely to attract page views. ??You know exactly what you're getting with all our headlines,?? Massoumi said.There was one glaring problem: less traffic. When Facebook changed its algorithm to disrupt the financial incentives for fake news, the tweaks had a collateral effect on the whole ecosystem of businesses built on its news feed, including Massoumi's liberal property. Traffic for TruthExaminer went down 60 percent starting in March and hasn't recovered, according to Nicole James, his editor-in-chief.??We never broke the rules that were constantly changing,'' James said. ??I did everything I'm supposed to do. We don't steal, we don't cheat. But I get people who message me and say, ??I don't see your posts anymore.'??To build a business on Facebook is to accept volatility. The company has played host to many startups tuned specifically for what its algorithm rewards, only to crush them later. In 2014, the feel-good website?Upworthy reached almost 90 million unique visitors, built on curiosity-gap headlines like ??9 Out of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact.?? That same year, changes to the news feed algorithm cut the traffic in half, forcing Upworthy to change its strategy. In 2016, as Facebook started to prioritize video in its news feed, the tech news site Mashable dismissed writers to focus more intently on the visual medium. The strategy didn't save the website, which?sold?last week for $50 million, a fraction of its prior valuation. More job cuts are expected.Now partisan news sites are reacting to Facebook's changes to give lower rank to sensationalism, clickbait and misinformation. Massoumi said he saw no reward for his higher-quality content. He saw competitors get even more aggressive to beat the algorithm, and succeed. The experience reinforced what he's known for years to be the only unchanging Facebook rule: Whoever gets the most attention wins.That's at the root of the fake news crisis. Massoumi, 26, started MrConservative.com in 2012, mostly because he thought he understood enough about information going viral on Facebook to get rich off the ads, and because he enjoyed sparking controversy after growing up in a highly liberal part of the country -- Marin County, just north of San Francisco. He used Facebook ads to target conservatives who might be interested in his page, and then served them content that reinforced their beliefs and made them angry.??News on Facebook revolves around analytics, so we know that we can only write a 250-word article, we know the title has to be tilted,'' he said, using his term for bias. ??We know we have to exclude the facts because if we say anything good about the other side people are like, ??oh, you're a closet liberal,' or on the liberal side, ??oh, you're a closet conservative.' So there is no room to be objective, there is no room to deliver quality.''Once others caught on to how profitable the practice was, it became highly competitive. The hyper-partisan sites would keep track of each others' headlines and rewrite them to draw more eyeballs. MrConservative.com aimed to put out more content, and faster. Sometimes that meant not checking whether it was true.??In 2014, I was too drunk to realize that there was no editorial value there,'' Massoumi said. ??I was too busy spending the money.'' The site continued to thrive around Trump's election, drawing $150,000 in monthly revenue at its peak, Massoumi said.Around the same time, Facebook was grappling with its role in political media. More than two-thirds of U.S. adults use the site, and a majority of those read news on the social network, according to a Pew Research Center study. The company had been criticized for manually curating a trending topics tool for its news feed in a way that was bias against conservatives. The accepted news sites that contractors could curate on Facebook, for example, didn't include the far-right website Breitbart.?In response, Facebook decided to be more hands-off, cutting the human curators in the run-up to election day. Meanwhile, sites like Massoumi's were becoming more influential. Reports surfaced about viral, false partisan news -- like Donald Trump's bogus endorsement from the Pope -- raising concern about what information was affecting people's views. When Trump was elected U.S. president last November, Facebook faced an uproar over its handling of fake news, and the company quickly vowed that its first step would be to disrupt any financial incentives for such content.Still, Facebook is intentionally unclear about what is and isn't allowed on its site. The company doesn't explicitly ban fake news, and remains especially uninterested in policing partisan content, still fearful of appearing biased. Facebook's program?using third-party fact checkers?to combat fake news only scratches the surface of the problem. Even during congressional hearings over the Russian propaganda that spread on its platform, Facebook said many of the misleading news stories would have been allowed -- if they had been posted by?real users rather than fictitious people.Massoumi's TruthExaminer toned down its tactics to fit what it thinks Facebook wants, but the site?still publishes headlines with like ??Sarah Huckabee Sanders Just Launched A DISGUSTING And Shameful Attack on Pres. Obama???and ??Donald Trump Once Took Revenge On A FAMILY MEMBER By Cutting Off Health Coverage For a a Sick Infant, This Is REVOLTING!???For the Facebook algorithm, provocative and hyperbolic language can be an indicator of clickbait, according to a spokesman. Facebook declined to say whether that's hurting TruthExaminer?because the company's?policy is not to?comment?on specific users or pages.Much of the controversial content still exists on Facebook, it's just harder to find as the company experiments with giving lower rank to whatever it deems bad quality. And publishers are left to read the tea leaves.Omar Rivero, who runs a different liberal site, Occupy Democrats, also saw a shortfall in traffic a few months ago that ??made it a lot harder to go viral.'' He equates the hit to what happened in 2014, when Upworthy got crushed.??Every site is going through the same thing,'' Rivero said. ??We powered through the changes four years ago, we'll power through them again.''Rivero said he's been able to get?back close to his election-time numbers, by producing ??higher-quality content.?? He has contacts at Facebook who help explain what that means. TruthExaminer doesn't, but Rivero has little sympathy for Massoumi.??They're owned by a Republican, so their agenda is just to make money,'' Rivero said.Massoumi doesn't deny it. He's turning his bedroom into a video studio so he can contract some ??very likable liberals?? to do rants on the site, similar to Tomi Lahren's popular tirades on the right, which tend to go viral on Facebook. Massoumi's looking to hire a more robust editorial team, too.But instead of relying solely on Facebook ads to keep his site afloat, he's eyeing a bigger payout down the road.??I'll offload the property in the next election cycle,?? Massoumi said. ??I'll go for the eight-figure deal.??"
Bitcoin Is Challenging the Entire Concept of Venture Capital,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/bitcoin-is-challenging-the-entire-concept-of-venture-capital,"December 18, 2017, 8:50 AM EST",technology,,"In the salad days of bitcoin, venture capital firms bought into the craze in a roundabout way. Instead of simply purchasing bitcoins, they invested in companies like Coinbase, which makes a wallet for digital currencies, or 21.co, which aimed to improve the process of mining coins. Some of these bets were better than others. 21 has changed names and business plans, but Coinbase's?app hit the No. 1 spot?on Apple's App Store this month as the hyperventilation over bitcoin reached an extreme.Meanwhile, the value of a bitcoin went from about $110 when Coinbase received its first major round of venture funding?to $19,000?as of Sunday. ??All the money that's been put into Coinbase, etcetera, would have returned much better if it was put directly into bitcoin,?? said Travis Scher, an investment associate at the Digital Currency Group, a bitcoin-centric investment firm.This realization complicates the basic concept of venture capital. Traditionally, investors identify an emerging technology trend, align themselves with the startups best positioned to ride the wave?and cash out when the company goes public or sells out.?This wasn't the best strategy for bitcoin, and the emergence of hundreds of new digital currencies are further confusing things. A?new wave of entrepreneuers, dreamers?and hucksters are raising capital through initial coin offerings, where they invent their own currencies, then sell them for cash and trade them on open markets. The service VCs offer to their investors is unfettered access to exciting private companies, whose shares aren't publicly traded. If ICOs become a durable way for anyone to get a piece of a hot technology??a big ??if,?? to be sure??where do VCs fit in?Driven by a combination of enthusiasm and fear, venture firms are developing new tricks to cash in on the cryptocurrency frenzy. Instead of taking an ownership stake in a company, some of the biggest investors in Silicon Valley have begun buying the rights to acquire tokens ahead of an ICO through novel legal agreements. In other cases, they're adding language to traditional equity deals guaranteeing investors get tokens if the startup ever decides to hold an ICO in the future. ??If there's an exciting new area, and we think a lot of new value will be created, it's our job to participate in some way,?? said Matt Huang, a partner at Sequoia Capital.The most straightforward way to bet on bitcoin, of course, would be to buy bitcoins. Many tech investors have been doing so with their own money for years. Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook Inc. executive and founder of the venture firm Social Capital, began buying in 2012. He holds the currency in a retirement account and through Social Capital via an investment in a business partner's company. Palihapitiya said he and his partners held about 5 percent of bitcoins in circulation five years ago and maintain a smaller, though still sizable, stake today.Other VCs prefer to keep their crypto-investments private. One investor expressed cybersecurity concerns. People with known bitcoin holdings have been subject to hacking attacks and threats of physical theft. Bitcoin is different from most types of financial investments because if someone steals it, it's gone forever.To get in on the boom without worrying about managing digital currencies themselves, several high-profile venture firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Sequoia Capital, have invested in so-called crypto hedge funds, such as?Polychain Capital?and MetaStable. These firms make money trading bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies like ethereum or litecoin, and dabble in ICOs markets.VCs are also buying new types of currencies in lieu of investing in the companies creating them.?Sequoia Capital, Union Square Ventures?and Bain Capital Ventures all said they've made deals to acquire digital tokens. To do this, they use a new type of legal contract known as Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFT.?Andreessen Horowitz has done about 10 such deals and is considering dozens more, said a person familiar with the firm's business, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. The firm has also been adding provisions to standard investment contracts to address ICOs??a practice other firms are adopting as well, according to several investors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Startups have raised more than $3.6 billion in ICOs so far this year, according to the research website Coinschedule. That pales in comparison to the $52.6 billion from VCs worldwide, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers and CB Insights. Experienced investors are skeptical about token sales as fundraising??in part because they can undermine the masochistic tendencies helpful for nurturing a startup. In traditional venture deals, entrepreneurs typically must wait years to turn their paper wealth into cash. An ICO, by contrast, can give them millions immediately. The newly rich aren't always motivated to work through the weekends.Huang, of Sequoia Capital, said the token sales the firm is taking part in have developed structures that mirror traditional venture deals. The firm prefers that companies dole out tokens over time, mimicking vesting periods in equity deals for startups.? ??Just because it's novel doesn't mean we have to reinvent everything from scratch,?? he said.Venture investors will need to reckon with a similar temptation.?Exchanges for digital tokens operate around the clock, offering immediate payouts. VCs aren't used to constantly reevaluating a company's market value to find the perfect moment to sell. ??We are long-term investors; we did not invest to buy and flip,?? said Scher, the investor from the Digital Currency Group. ??But even if you're long-term bullish on a project, how do you say, ??I'm just not going to sell,' when something goes up 6x in 48 hours???"

Last month, he sued a corporate research firm founded by Republican campaign veterans, claiming it was trying to spread false allegations about him. The firm, Definers Public Affairs, denied the allegations and said it had never done work regarding Pishevar.??As that legal case progresses, it is my priority to ensure that the Sherpa Capital family is not adversely affected,?? Pishevar wrote Tuesday in an emailed statement. ??I am confident I will be vindicated.??Five women who met Pishevar in a professional context told Bloomberg they were sexually assaulted or harassed by him. In each case, the women accused Pishevar of exploiting a professional connection, and using the prospect of a job, mentorship or investment to make an unwanted sexual advance. Current and former colleagues of a sixth woman, Uber executive Austin Geidt, told Bloomberg that he groped her at the Uber holiday party in December 2014.Virgin Hyperloop One called a board meeting Sunday, where directors discussed allegations covered in the Bloomberg story and raised the prospect that Pishevar should step down, people with knowledge of the event said this week. On Monday, two high-profile Democratic senators, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, said they had redirected money Pishevar had given to their campaigns or committees to organizations for sexual assault or domestic violence victims. Pishevar, a major connector of the technology industry to Washington, has donated more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and causes.In May, Pishevar was arrested at a hotel in London after a woman accused him of raping her. Police said Pishevar was ??released under investigation?? and never charged. Last month, Forbes and other publications reported on a document purported to be a police report, which turned out to be fabricated, according to London police. Pishevar said in his statement Tuesday: ??I hope to unearth who fabricated the fraudulent London ??police report' and who is responsible for spreading false rumors about me.??For more on sexual harassment in Silicon Valley, check out the?Decrypted? podcast:Pishevar co-founded both Sherpa Capital, where he retains the title of managing director, and Virgin Hyperloop One, where he's co-executive chairman.?In an email to the Virgin Hyperloop One board reviewed by Bloomberg, Pishevar said he would transfer his voting rights to Russian investor Ziyavudin Magomedov, who was named co-executive chairman in October.

Trump said Thursday as his administration released its Unified Agenda, a twice-a-year report on the government's plans for new regulations. Trump cut a red ribbon between two stacks of paper, a smaller one marked 1960 and a larger one marked ""Today,?? as Trump said the federal regulatory code had grown from 20,000 pages to 185,000 pages during the period.The sheets of paper were all blank. A White House spokeswoman said they used blank pages rather than the actual regulatory code so the paper could be re-used.Early in his administration, Trump ordered that two existing regulations be repealed for any new one put on the books. Trump said his administration had beat the goal, with 22 deregulatory actions for each new regulation. The administration had in its first 11 months canceled or delayed 1,500 planned regulatory actions, he said.But a Bloomberg News analysis of the earlier version of the regulation report found that Trump and other administration officials had exaggerated claims of cutting almost 1,000 regulations.The administration counted in its earlier report as canceled hundreds of pending regulations that had been effectively shelved before Trump took office. Others listed as withdrawn are actually still being developed by federal agencies. Still more were moot because the actions sought in a pending rule were already in effect.The administration didn't immediately release a detailed explanation of Trump's most recent claims.Trump and top administration officials say they've rolled back hundreds of regulations that had imposed billions of dollars of regulatory costs. The plan published Thursday detailed additional efforts to eliminate red tape.?Of the 469 regulatory actions the Trump administration said in its earlier report that it had ??withdrawn?? this year, 42 percent were as good as dead already. Some 180 of them weren't listed on President Barack Obama's final agenda of upcoming rules, meaning there were no immediate plans to impose them. In many cases, there had been no activity on them in years, records show. Another 15 had been halted under Obama before Trump took office. At least three more were listed in error or were moot because the rule-making was continuing.Republicans in Congress did use the Congressional Review Act to knock down more than a dozen regulations enacted during the final months of the Obama administration, ranging from from an Interior Department rule governing runoff from mines to a financial watchdog agency's rule making it easier for consumers to sue banks and a measure to deter people with mental illnesses from being able to purchase firearms.The administration has dramatically slowed the adoption of new rules. The White House's regulation-oversight arm, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, had completed reviews on just 52 final rules through Nov. 29, according to its records. Obama's OIRA team had finalized reviews on more than four times that many during the same period last year.?? With assistance by Jesse Hamilton, Shannon Pettypiece, and Jennifer Epstein"

They'll also give a push for increasing climate-related aid to developing nations, in step with a United Nations goal of channeling at least $100 billion a year by 2020. Trump is not scheduled to attend.The meetings are designed to preserve the the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change sealed two years ago. That deal brought together some 200 nations including the U.S. and China in calling for limits on fossil fuel emissions everywhere for the first time. Trump's move to pull back from the accord, along with efforts to preserve coal jobs in Germany and Poland, have undercut momentum toward cleaner forms of energy.??The Trump decision was a blow, but it hasn't killed the process,?? said Herve Le Treut, a senior climate scientist at France's National Center for Scientific Research in Paris. ??If the Paris climate accord accomplished one thing, it was a change of consciousness around the world. We've seen many more initiatives since then.??For Macron, who has sought to put France at the center of issues ranging from Middle East peace to European economic rival since his surprise electoral victory last May, the meetings are part of his effort to building the standing of France in shaping world affairs. The 39-year old French president is stepping into a leadership vacuum left as Trump focuses on an ??America first?? foreign policy German Chancellor Angela Merkel is mired in talks to form a new government.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Monday called for the carbon price to triple to 30 euros a ton to provide industry a signal that it must invest in cleaning up emissions. He was speaking an in interview at the start of a day on how to boost climate-related funding and reach UN's $100 billion goal for 2020.???We have to explain to people that some activities are not the right ones,?? Le Maire said on Bloomberg Television. ??Coal fired plants have to close down.??Since the UN goal was agreed in 2009, money has started to flow from richer nations to less developed ones, with the annual total reaching $62 billion in 2014, according to the latest data available from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.??Finance will be a key topic of the event,?? said Simone Tagliapietra, analyst at the Bruegel research group in Brussels. ??We know that we will need more renewables and energy efficiency, but at the end of the day it will happen only if somebody puts their money in it.??Companies from the software developer Microsoft Corp. to insurer AXA SA also plan to announce initiatives at the event, underscoring Macron's assertion that efforts to fix the climate are picking up steam.The Paris deal called on all nations to make voluntary emissions cuts. The ambition was to keep the temperature increases well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). A degree of warming over the past century already has been blamed for stronger storms, more frequent floods and droughts and rising seas. The World Meteorological Agency has warned that without swifter action, the planet is on course for a much sharper warming by the end of the century.??There is an urgency to do more,?? said Wendel Trio, director of CAN Europe, which represents 140 environmental groups in 30 nations. ??We are not on track to implement the Paris Agreement.??Even so, doubts are rising about commitments to the Paris agenda, and Trump isn't alone in his reluctance to follow the deal.?On Tuesday Macron will host leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Mexican President Enrique Nieto, as well as mayors of Quito, Seoul and Buenos Aires and California Governor Jerry Brown.

Charlie Ergen's Job Change Points to Dish's Costly Network Plan,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/billionaire-ergen-s-job-change-points-to-costly-network-plan,"December 5, 2017, 3:09 PM EST",technology,"""Wall Street had long expected Dish to sell its spectrum"", ""‘They still have a lot of options,' Jefferies's Goldman says""","Charlie Ergen's relinquishment of his CEO title to focus on wireless strategy is a signal that his Dish Network Corp. is dead serious about building its own network, a plan that once seemed unlikely.A costly construction project to create a data network from scratch was once seen as a last resort for Dish, which owns about $39 billion worth of wireless airwaves and has to use at least part of them by the Federal Communications Commission's March 2020 deadline. Many analysts had expected Ergen to sell the spectrum, to join forces with a current wireless carrier to build a network, or to work with a ??tenant?? such as Amazon.com Inc. or Facebook Inc. to provide services to their customers.The possibility of lining up a partner remains open, but the window for such dealmaking is closing fast. With the FCC's deadline looming, Dish probably has to develop a build-out plan and start construction by the end of 2018, Scott Goldman, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC, said in a phone interview. If Dish doesn't meet the cutoff date, it could be in trouble, as the FCC ??appears to have little patience for granting an extension after all this time,?? Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffetNathanson LLC, said in an email.??It is becoming clearer than ever that the path forward for Dish Network is to build a network rather than to sell its spectrum,?? Moffett said.Earlier this year, Moffett had been projecting that Dish would need to invest $2.6 billion to $4 billion through 2020 to complete a network. But a likely delay in getting access to some airwaves means it will now be ??vastly more expensive?? for the company to build one that would satisfy FCC rules, he said. If Dish doesn't start using the airwaves, it could lose the rights to them.Dish could cut costs by building a so-called narrowband network that provides internet connections to various devices but not full mobile services like AT&T Inc. or Verizon Communications Inc. But, ??it's not clear that a narrowband network would comply with FCC requirements, nor is there a viable revenue model associated?? with it, Moffett said in an email.Ergen might still strike deals with partners to shoulder at least part -- if not all -- of the burden. T-Mobile US Inc. may be looking to beef up its spectrum holdings since its merger talks with Sprint Corp. unraveled earlier this year. Verizon Communications Inc. could need additional airwaves as well, Goldman said, although the company recently signaled it's not looking for acquisitions.The wireless companies may need more capacity to meet their users' growing data needs.

The Next-Generation Elevator Is Not for the Fainthearted,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-21/the-next-generation-elevator-is-not-for-the-fainthearted,"December 20, 2017, 7:01 PM EST",technology,"""Thyssenkrupp is testing lifts with magnets instead of pulleys"", ""CEO says potential for growth in industry is encouraging""","If you're faint of heart, beware.At a testing site in southwestern Germany, one of the world's largest elevator companies is stepping up trials of the first system to operate without cables. Thyssenkrupp AG's futuristic lift defies?a basic design that has varied little over hundreds of years. Instead of being attached to ropes and pulleys, it soars up and across shafts with the help of magnets.??Psychologically, there's no difference,?? said?Andreas Schierenbeck, chief executive of the Thyssenkrupp Elevators division, dismissing any fear factor that comes with the technology. ??Some people were afraid to step into elevators even with a cable.??With the first commercial deployment planned for 2020 in a building in Berlin, the maglev elevator called Multi will put the German engineering company a step ahead of rivals Otis, Kone Oyj and Schindler Holdings AG.?Ranked fourth in the world by sales, Thyssenkrupp is betting the lift will provide an edge just as the market -- estimated at 60 billion euros ($71 billion) by Jefferies -- is poised for growth, driven by demand in dense urban centers for tall buildings.Thyssenkrupp lags behind the other three big elevator manufacturers in revenue. Bloomberg
??Thyssenkrupp's main advantage right now is being first in the field,?? said David Varga, an analyst at Bankhaus Metzler who recommends buying the stock. Developing a new technology will help the company to at least retain market share in an industry where gaining significantly on rivals is ??very hard.????It's interesting from a branding perspective,?? he said, adding that the company will have certain short-term benefits even though the new product won't add to the bottom line for at least a few more years.Thyssenkrupp's elevator division started out as a sideline for the parent company, which is Germany's biggest steelmaker. In the past six years, amid a global steel glut?that led a collapse in prices and a planned merger with rival Tata Steel Ltd., the unit has emerged as a cash cow, earning more than the company's other businesses.To read about the steelmaker's reliance on elevators for profit, click hereThyssenkrupp's Multi elevator will be in a category of its own, technologically.?Kone is focusing on making cables lighter for ultra-tall buildings like Saudi Arabia's Jeddah Tower. The Finnish company, which has a testing site 350 meters underground in a limestone mine, also offers double-decker elevator cabins. Otis, owned by United Technologies Corp., has developed high-speed lifts.Unlike traditionally-designed systems, Thyssenkrupp says the Multi will make ferrying people around buildings more efficient. For instance, more than one of the elevator cabins can use the same shaft, zipping up and down and even moving horizontally to get out of the way of another cabin in its path. This flexibility could allow greater architectural leeway and ultimately change city skylines.??You get your freedom back - you don't have to use the elevator shaft as the main element?? of design around which buildings are conceived,?Schierenbeck said in an interview this month at the company's headquarters in Essen. The new elevators could run on the outside of buildings, or move sideways between parking lots and concierge desks, he said.While the magnetic system is more expensive than traditional designs, developers can save money by using fewer and smaller shafts, freeing up precious floor space, according to Schierenbeck. Company estimates show the investment becomes worthwhile for buildings taller than 250 meters (820 feet) or about 80 stories. OVG's East Side Tower in Berlin, where the lift will make its debut, will stand at only about 140 meters, although the developers have widely promoted the innovation.Thyssenkrupp Elevator's goal of making 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes is within reach, the executive said, adding that the target for 15 percent profit margin might take a little longer.While the key Chinese market has slowed amid weaker property development and tougher competition, Schierenbeck sees rising demand in the coming decades as hundreds of millions of Chinese move to cities.??The progress we are making is maybe good, but maybe not fast enough,?? he said. ??We could do better. Maybe that's me being the typical German engineer, always looking at the things that are not working.???? With assistance by Niclas Rolander"

"FedEx, UPS Want to Steer Santa's Packages to the Local Drugstore",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/fedex-ups-want-to-steer-santa-s-packages-to-the-local-drugstore,"December 14, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",business,"""Record parcel shipments expected again this holiday season"", ""Alternate sites may be used most for online purchase returns""","It's that time of year again when online shopping surges and package deliveries soar -- along with costs and customer expectations.United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. are emphasizing new strategies to ease the burden of rising e-commerce deliveries as?the National Retail Federation predicts online sales will rise as much as 15 percent this holiday season. One big move: the couriers are expanding neighborhood locations where customers can pick up parcels or drop off returns in lieu of the usual front-porch option.While revenue is rising as UPS and FedEx deliver more packages by truck than ever, profit margins on those sales are shrinking, said Lee Klaskow, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. Neighborhood centers are just one part of the effort to get control of the problem as shippers explore options ranging from drone deliveries to surcharges.??To deliver a package to my house every day is very expensive for them,?? Klaskow said. ??That's the biggest challenge for profit and income growth.??The calculation is an easy one for shipping companies, which save time and money by allowing drivers to drop off several packages at one spot. Drivers often have to navigate suburban labyrinths to deliver a single box, increasing transport costs and eating away minutes in strained schedules that become especially strenuous during the peak shopping season.Consumers may be a harder sell. FedEx and UPS are both pitching the sites, which include drugstores and supermarkets, as a customer convenience that provides more flexibility and security.??Packages stacked on front porches is a concern,?? Randy Scarborough, FedEx vice president of retail marketing, said in an interview. ??More consumers want other options to have packages delivered instead of home. If work is not a good alternative, then some place near home might be a better option.??Adding an incentive for customers who choose its Access Point locations, UPS waives the surcharge that it's imposed?on home deliveries during this holiday season.Still, the problem for UPS and FedEx is that it's hard to beat having packages delivered straight to your front door. It's ??enormously more convenient,?? said Rob Martinez, chief executive of Shipware, which advises parcel-shipping companies. He and other experts believe home delivery will continue to be most customers' first choice.While customers taking advantage of UPS Access Point counters are ??significantly above?? last year, they still amount to less than 1 percent of industry delivery volume, said Satish Jindel, president of SJ Consulting Group.UPS and FedEx are pushing ahead with programs to provide alternatives. While a lot of people may prefer front-door delivery, ""there are more people who want options,?? Scarborough said.U.S. online sales this year will reach more than $459 billion, up slightly from 2016, according to a report from Forrester Research Inc. Over the Thanksgiving weekend and Cyber Monday, sales spiked 18 percent from last year to $14.5 billion, according to Adobe Analytics.Those after-Thanksgiving online orders inundated UPS, delaying some deliveries early this month and forcing drivers to work longer holiday hours. UPS expects to deliver 750 million packages globally during this peak shipping season, while FedEx has forecast it will handle as many as 400 million.Home drop-offs, especially those involving just one package, are the least-profitable deliveries, said Kevin Sterling, analyst at Seaport Global Holdings. ""It takes time to go house to house. It's all about density.""In a major expansion of its new FedEx OnSite program this year, the courier opened parcel counters in 7,500 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. stores across all 50 states. More than 500 grocery stores, including Kroger Co. or Albertsons Cos., also have FedEx pick up and drop off locations.UPS launched its U.S. Access Point network in 2014. Not counting thousands of sites inside its retail stores, the shipping company now has about 4,000 locations in places like grocery stores, dry cleaners and ??mom-and-pop?? merchants.Of course, to have any significant impact in easing margin pressures, ??The adoption by consumers is pretty important for those to be successful,?? said Bloomberg's Klaskow.Customers who direct parcels to the sites must show identification to collect their package. Parcels are held five days by FedEx Onsite before they're returned, and seven days at UPS Access Points. Customers must pack and label packages before dropping them off.Young adults, especially those needing to return an item bought online, may lead the way in using the alternative sites. About 30 percent of e-commerce purchases are returned, FedEx's Scarborough said.A recent study by Narvar Inc., which advises companies on online customer service, found 41 percent of those under age 30 expressed interest in using a nearby location like a grocery store for returns. When all ages were included, it dropped to 28 percent.During the five-day shopping period over the Thanksgiving holiday, shoppers in their mid-20s to mid-30s were the biggest spenders in stores and online. Members of that age group shelled out $419.52 each on average for gifts, or 25 percent more than the average shopper, according to a National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics survey.To get wider adoption, two key things will need to happen, said Trevor Outman, president of the consultant Shipware. Shippers such as FedEx will need to include the feature prominently on their websites, and the option needs to be easy enough to use that it truly will add convenience for customers, he said.""The adoption in the marketplace is to be determined,"" Outman said. ""But you can count on the carriers pushing for early market adoption.""?? With assistance by Matthew Boyle, and Lindsey Rupp"

For Indonesian ride-hailing and food-delivery startup Go-Jek, the push back is coming from the lunch ladies at Jakarta Intercultural School.The school banned Indonesia's first billion-dollar tech startup from delivering takeout lunches to its 2,400 students in August after dozens of drivers in Go-Jek's signature green and black jackets began bombarding the high school during lunchtime and diverting revenue from the cafeteria, run by food giant Sodexo SA.The school's main gripe: Delivery meals create unwanted waste and are high in sugar and salt, says school spokeswoman Dyah Lestarina. Sodexo says it agrees with the school's decisions.Students miffed about returning to cafeteria grub took to the school newspaper to make the case that they should decide what to eat -- not the school. They argued for options beyond Sodexo and The Booster Hut, a parent-run bistro and bookstore whose proceeds benefit varsity sports teams.""The Go-Jek ban is unjustified,"" Nicky Hancock,?from the class of 2019, was quoted saying, explaining some students don't feel like the ""Sodexo and Booster Hut foods fit their needs.""The student uproar is just a small example of a bigger wave of protests unfolding around the globe as tech startups threaten big, established players.London revoked Uber's license to operate ride-hailing services in September,?which the ride-hailing app is appealing. Berlin cracked down on short-term apartment rentals like those through Airbnb last year. China recently outlawed new online micro-lenders.What began with Uber undercutting traditional taxi companies that obtained expensive licenses and saw themselves as playing by the rules, has spread to hotels, restaurants, banks and other industries hit by an expanding suite of on-demand services.JIS's Lestarina says the decision remains firmly in place, noting the delivery ban applies to all food delivery to students during school hours and isn't restricted to Go-Jek.Go-Jek, which has 600,000 drivers and 100,000 merchants, has already expanded to 17 different types of services as varied as house cleaning, doctor visits, massages and hijab styling, part of its suite of ""Go-Glam"" offerings.

""Like Amazon became the Everything Store, Go-Jek will become the every service app.""Go-Jek spent years battling Indonesia's motorbike and taxi industry. It successfully fought alongside Uber and Grab to overturn a government ban on using private vehicles for public transport and quelled violent protests by taxi drivers who brought traffic in Jakarta to a screeching halt.In January, Go-Jek forged the ultimate truce: An alliance with PT Blue Bird Group, Indonesia's largest taxi operator with more than 20,000 drivers. Go-Jek now lets users order Blue Bird cars right from the Go-Jek app.While the ride-hailing giant declined to comment specifically on the Jakarta Intercultural School's ban, a spokeswoman said the company ""always believes in collaboration.""??

It's the second major hire by Uber's new CEO?Dara Khosrowshahi, who in October appointed Tony West -- PepsiCo Inc.'s general counsel and a former U.S. Justice Department official -- as chief legal officer.??There is a broader societal benefit here and fundamentally that's the kind of thing I'm attracted to,?? Harford, 45, said in an interview. ??It is very clear that the way the company was run before is not acceptable and we absolutely need to change. I know Dara's way of operating and he knows mine.??Harford has worked for and competed with Khosrowshahi, 48, in the online travel business. In 2004, Harford became president for Asia Pacific at Expedia Inc., where Khosrowshahi became CEO in 2005. When Harford took over troubled, debt-laden Orbitz Worldwide Inc. in 2009, he became one of his former boss's chief rivals.??Dara and I were both super competitive,?? Harford said. ??Through all that we remained good friends. That's just business. That's just competition. We compete aggressively but we compete in the right way.??Harford sold Orbitz to Expedia in 2015 for $1.6 billion. Harford has been working as a senior adviser to Khosrowshahi at Uber since October.

Uber lost $1.5 billion in the third quarter of this year, up from $1.1 billion in the prior quarter. Net revenue increased to $2.01 billion in period, up 21 percent from the previous quarter.??Obviously Uber is a large global complex business and these two have both proven their intellectual and leadership chops in large global businesses,?? said Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner, who was a major shareholder in Orbitz and helped recruit Harford to United's board.Khosrowshahi joined Uber after a series of scandals forced Kalanick to resign as CEO. When Khosrowshahi started at Uber in September, he told employees he was leaning against picking a COO.Khosrowshahi's first few months on the job convinced him that he had to take a different role than the one he played at Expedia. Uber required a CEO who was more a public face of the company. Khosrowshahi was meeting with regulators in London who had revoked Uber's license when he had to work with the board of directors over a deal for SoftBank Group Corp. to invest in the company. Later, he visited Brazil to win over lawmakers there.Bill Gurley, a former Uber board member, said venture capital firm Benchmark ranked Harford among the tech industry's top CEOs. ??Having someone who thinks obsessively about the right business model, the right pricing strategy, all those things are super, super valuable,?? Gurley said. ??I've been trying to find a way to work with him.??Harford will oversee Uber's trio of powerful regional general managers --?Rachel Holt, Andrew Macdonald and Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty -- along with Jason Droege, who heads food-delivery and other Uber businesses.Uber's board is searching for an independent chair. Board members David Trujillo, Wan Ling Martello and Garrett Camp are spearheading that effort. Khosrowshahi is also looking to hire a chief financial officer.??This is a business that is at really substantial scale that continues to grow really attractively. It's a business where the focus really has been on growth rather than making the business function more efficiently, more effectively,?? Harford said. ??There are so many things that are just calling out for us to go in and improve to achieve operational discipline to allow us to streamline costs.??"

Does Net Neutrality's Repeal Create a Regulatory Crack or a Chasm?,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/does-net-neutrality-s-repeal-create-regulatory-crack-or-a-chasm,"December 15, 2017, 4:00 AM EST",politics,"""Agencies, lawsuits, politics will dictate internet oversight"", ""States don't want to sit on sidelines after FCC steps back""","The Federal Communication Commission's decision to scrap net-neutrality rules doesn't necessarily mean the internet won't be regulated.Whether the oversight void left by the FCC's action is a small crevice or a giant canyon depends on what role other agencies play, as well as decisions by courts and policymakers.Here are some ways it may play out:FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, has said has the Federal Trade Commission can monitor for anti-competitive practices. Critics, including?one of the FTC's own commissioners, Democratic appointee Terrell McSweeny, say those agencies don't have expertise and act only after abuses occur, rather than setting rules that guide behavior.The FTC's ability to do so may hinge on its winning a court fight with AT&T Mobility LLC over the carrier's alleged failure to tell customers who signed up for unlimited data that it would throttle that flow after a pre-set volume.The AT&T broadband unit last year convinced a three-judge panel of a west coast appeals court that the FTC's oversight power is blocked. The reasoning was that parent company AT&T Inc. still provides conventional landline telephone service, making it a common carrier -- something the trade commission is barred from regulating. An 11-judge panel is weighing whether the earlier ruling was a mistake.The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division could also step into the regulatory breach, should one or more of the now-deregulated internet service providers engage in conduct it deems harmful to competition. It's already sued AT&T and Time Warner Inc. to block their $85.4 billion merger on those grounds.Pai's plan expressly bars individual states from becoming internet service provider cops on the theory that national providers should be governed by uniform federal regulations, not a patchwork of local requirements.But the states aren't completely sidelined and still wield consumer-protection power, said Matthew Schettenhelm, an attorney and government litigation analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.Former FCC Associate General Counsel Randolph May, now president of the Free State Foundation, a free-market think tank, agreed. ""What I don't believe that the FCC is purporting to do is preempt the states from enforcing their own consumer-protection laws,"" he said.Still, the line between where federal authority ends and a state's power to protect its citizens begins may need to be drawn by the courts.State attorneys general from New York, Pennsylvania and Washington threatened lawsuits immediately after the FCC's vote aimed at undoing the agency's repeal.Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said he'll mount a challenge based on the Administrative Procedures Act, a law designed to prevent an incoming administration from overturning its predecessor's acts without showing a need or change in circumstance. New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman also announced plans to sue, as did Free Press, an activist group that helped organized the opposition to the FCC's party-line vote.But the lawsuits face an uphill battle because courts generally defer to the expertise of federal agencies, said James Speta, a Northwestern University law professor who favored the net neutrality rules.Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward J. Markey said he would mount a two-pronged attack to preserve the rules. Besides supporting legal action, he and other lawmakers said they would introduce a resolution under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to overturn some actions of regulatory agencies.Congress could write a law to overrule the FCC's action, and Republicans and broadband providers have asked it to step in. Democrats have resisted, saying legislation proposed so far would unacceptably weaken the FCC's power to protect internet users.The Democrats' ??wall of resistance?? may weaken in the new year after partisan fervor heightened by Thursday's vote has a chance to abate, Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant said in a Nov. 21 note. A bill might restore some basic net neutrality protections and also bar the FCC from regulating rates, Gallant said.The election of a Democrat as president in 2020 could prompt yet another reversal, said Speta. But, he added, ""I don't think that's the best way to make policy."""

Its project in Argentina is scheduled to start producing in mid 2019.The company needs to diversify geographically regardless of the conflict with Corfo and wants to add a fourth country to the mix, the officials said.With surging lithium prices boosting margins, SQM's ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization has fallen to 0.3, the lowest in at least a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an average of 7.2 among members of the Solactive Global Lithium Index.SQM shares have jumped 82 percent this year as part of a lithium-producer rally. That would be the company's best year in the stock market in more than two decades.Argentina and Australia are attracting the largest number of new lithium projects, said Daniela Desormeaux, chief executive officer of Santiago-based lithium consulting firm SignumBOX, without referring specifically to SQM's prospects.""The rise in prices has meant that projects in other parts of the world have become attractive and profitable,"" she said. ""Today the market needs more projects and some that were not profitable five years ago could have a space now.""Other producing countries include the U.S., where Albemarle Corp. extracts lithium from brine, and Canada, where it can be extracted from rock. Countries such as Mexico and Serbia are yet to tap their lithium reserves."

Qatar Air currently owns 9.9 percent of Cathay, he said.??What happens in the future, of course, I cannot say because the aviation industry is very fluid at times,???Al Baker said. ??At the moment, we have no intention to go over the stated goal that we already have in mind. We will not go beyond 10 percent mark in Cathay for the time being.??Qatar Air bought 9.6 percent in Cathay from Hong Kong-based Kingboard Chemical Holdings Ltd. and related companies for HK$5.16 billion ($660 million) in November, making it the third-largest shareholder. The investment, coming months after being spurned by American Airlines Group Inc., would provide the Middle Eastern carrier access to mainland China, a country set to emerge as the world's biggest aviation market within a decade.Cathay has a huge potential to grow and the current restructuring efforts will help it overcome the tough times, Al Baker said.Cathay is in the midst of the biggest corporate revamp in two decades to help revive earnings after getting squeezed between Middle Eastern carriers such as Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways PJSC at the premium end of travel, and low-cost and mainland Chinese rivals at the other. It has announced job cuts and was in talks with pilots over compensation as it reported its worst half-year loss in at least two decades in the six months through June.??

"Inside Banks, Bitcoin Futures Are Riling Trading Executives",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-08/inside-big-banks-bitcoin-futures-are-riling-trading-executives,"December 8, 2017, 12:00 AM EST",business,"""Some say their desks are eager to wade into the new market"", ""But many confidentially list concerns and unresolved questions""","Bitcoin is coming to Wall Street on Sunday, and some executives at the world's biggest banks aren't sleeping well.With just a few days left until Cboe Global Markets Inc. debuts futures contracts on the cryptocurrency, many banks are still weighing whether to offer them to clients -- and if so, how to handle the mechanics. Several of the largest firms, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., aren't immediately offering clearing of the futures as they wait to see how it will work, according to people briefed on the plans.In interviews, some executives and traders said their desks are eager to get in on the action -- but most sounded cautionary notes, ticking off concerns and unanswered questions. Bitcoin's violent price swings this week have made the new market look all the more dangerous.The Price of Bitcoin Isn't Always What You Think It Is: GadflyAll of the people -- speaking from a half-dozen major firms -- asked not to be named, in some cases saying they're worried about contradicting their bosses' public statements. Others said it's still too early to take a position. These are a few of their top concerns:?Some bank CEOs and industry leaders have spent months deriding bitcoin publicly -- ??it's a fraud,?? ??the very definition of a bubble?? or an ??index for money laundering?? -- and who knows what they've said privately. Now, what will it look like if firms help clients into investments that blow up? How might internal commentary over the futures sound if it ever spills into legal cases? One executive, for example, privately referred to the cryptocurrency as ??sh*tcoin.??Enthusiasts say bitcoin is a currency. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission says it's a commodity. So does Goldman Sachs Group Inc. So it may seem natural for trading desks in those markets to handle the new contracts. But one executive said there's at least an argument to be made that equities desks (and delta one traders specifically) are used to the math: Bitcoin is like a volatile stock, and futures, at least in some ways, are like the options that track it.When asset prices are steady, it's relatively straightforward for banks to make markets: Help a customer buy or sell an asset, and then take some time to find another client who wants to take an opposite position. But bitcoin is too radioactive for banks to hold -- it swings wildly within minutes and there's no established model to account for it on the balance sheet. So banks will try to clear the new contracts, matching one investor with another. That can be tough. A few traders, for example, said many clients are only interested in shorting. That can make for a pretty hard day at the office: Without longs, the trades may be costly and hard to set up.This was laid out in a letter this week from the Futures Industry Association, which said Cboe and larger exchange operator CME Group Inc. are rushing the futures to market without a proper consideration of the risks. The trade group, made up of some of the world's largest derivatives brokerages, said it was concerned that the cryptocurrency's extreme volatility could lead investors to default if prices swing. That could sting firms that clear the contracts.It's going to be tough for big bureaucratic banks to figure out all of these mechanics -- and their own stomach for the business -- on a tight schedule. A person close to Goldman Sachs said on Thursday it will initially clear bitcoin contracts for certain clients on a case-by-case basis. Dutch lender ABN Amro Group NV said it will clear the futures for some clients who request specific approval, and said it has received fewer than 10 requests so far.Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada are in the camp with JPMorgan and Citigroup, deciding not to offer clearing right away, people briefed on their plans said. At some other firms, executives said they may enter when ready. So if they do choose to wade in, it'll be smooth.?But will a small presence from big players give an advantage to nimbler, risk-friendly firms that embrace the new market out of the gate???

That compares with 1,754 last year and 1,210 the prior year. In 2014, the year the administration first began collecting data, there were only 236 reported incidents.In response, the agency said in October that it wants to make it easier for enthusiasts to get permission to pilot low-level flights in restricted airspace. The agency said there has been so much pent-up demand that users have been willing to break the law to get their drones in the air.The number of reported incidents reached a new record of 260 in June. Incidents have risen compared to the same month in the prior year all but once since the FAA first started keeping records in February 2014. There have been a total of 4,889 incidents reported in less than four years.The FAA encourages pilots, air-traffic controllers and police to report incidents they believe raise safety concerns with drones. Most incidents involve drones apparently operating outside legal boundaries, which typically require that they fly within 400 feet of the ground and within sight of the person in control.?"

This U.K. Cyber Upstart Is Beating Silicon Valley Giants,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/sophos-bests-silicon-valley-with-u-k-cybersecurity-for-novices,"December 15, 2017, 1:00 AM EST",technology,"""IT security provider's stock jump beats California-based peers"", ""Sophos seeking to become U.K.'s ‘tech champion,' CFO says""","In a world where protecting against cyber crime is high on most big business agendas, a U.K. provider of IT security to?clients as small as dentists and neighborhood stores is outpacing the best that Silicon Valley has to offer.Sophos Group Plc shares have more than doubled in 2017, beating every other stock in the Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity Index, including larger California-based peers such as Symantec Corp. and Palo Alto Networks Inc. The stock has also left domestic equities trailing, being one of?the top five performers in the U.K.'s FTSE All-Share Index.Investors' appetite is understandable. After this year's?global WannaCry ransomware attacks and headline-grabbing hacks at Uber Technologies Inc. and Equifax Inc., demand for cyber security has never been greater -- whether you are a multinational corporation or a local shop owner. It's a platform that's giving Sophos some lofty ambitions in a British technology sector?that was jolted by the $32 billion Japanese takeover of ARM Holdings in July 2016.??We should be, we will be, the U.K. tech champion,?? Chief Financial Officer Nick Bray said in an interview.?To get there, Bray will need to overtake software giants including Sage Group Plc and his former employer Micro Focus?International Plc, whose market value of about 10.8 billion pounds ($14.5 billion) dwarfs Sophos's 2.5 billion pounds.The executive's optimism is mostly shared by analysts, with nine out of 10 having buy recommendations on the stock and none advising clients to sell. Morgan Stanley named Sophos its top European technology sector pick for 2018 in a note on Friday. Yet, after this year's gains, not all are bullish: KeyBanc's Rob Owens cut Sophos to sector weight last month when it was trading about 12 percent above its current price of 541 pence.???It's had a heck of a run,?? Owens said in an interview.???It's not overly expensive, but it's not overly cheap anymore.?? Trading about 31 times calendar 2018 free cash flow, the stock is ??fairly valued?? compared with?companies like Symantec and Qualys Inc., he said.Demand for Sophos's services is growing as cyber crime tactics evolve. According to Bray, criminal gangs are changing tack and aiming hacks at a large number of smaller companies instead of a handful of bigger corporations, making cybersecurity ??very relevant'' for smaller firms.Sophos's products are aimed at mid-market businesses with up to 5,000?employees, but also include very small companies that are ??playing catch up?? with the need to protect against cyberattacks, he said. A dental practice could lose access to its patient records, for example.While knowledge of IT security remains in the ??very embryonic?? stages, both general awareness and the sophistication of customers is increasing, Bray said.Read more: A QuickTake Q&A on how ransomware worksThe same game of catch-up appears to be happening with investors. Bray said Sophos was initially ??misunderstood?? when it sold stock in a 2015 initial public offering at 225 pence a share, having pulled a previous attempt at an IPO in 2007.?A challenge of listing in London over the U.S. was that ??we had to get the awareness up of what we did,?? Bray said.?Sophos has ??spent a lot of time educating?? investors on the size of its addressable market, its competitive position and its financial model, specifically the size of its customer base and its renewal rate, the executive said. In November, the company raised its outlook for the 2018 financial year, reporting 22 percent first-half billings growth and hailing its renewal rate, a growing base of subscription revenue and a 220 percent rise in sales of its Sophos Central cloud platform.After riding a wave in technology stocks for much of the year,?Sophos shares have slipped back with the sector in recent weeks, also weighed down by a share placing by early investor Apax Partners. That and some recent share sales by directors led to oversupply, a weak share price and ??misplaced concern about the fundamentals, which are very strong,?? said Numis analyst David Toms, who upgraded the stock to add from hold last week.Organic growth remains Sophos's primary focus, according to Bray. The company is always evaluating ??targeted technology tuck-ins?? to boost its offering via mergers and acquisitions. Any deals it does pursue, like the 2015 purchase of Dutch endpoint protection firm SurfRight and this year's acquisition of the software product arm of Invincea, would be done to expand the product offering and boost cross-selling scope, burnishing its organic growth potential.Yet the pace of the company's growth raises the question of whether Sophos may itself become a target. While no board members want to sell, ??it's not impossible,?? Bray said. ??You can never stop somebody knocking at the door.???? With assistance by James Cone"
Bitcoin Has a Future and You Can Go Long or Short: QuickTake Q&A;,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-17/buy-bitcoin-futures-why-that-isn-t-so-last-week-quicktake-q-a,"December 17, 2017, 5:00 AM EST",quicktake,,"Trading in bitcoin futures began a week ago on Cboe Global Markets Inc. Its bigger rival, CME Group Inc., began offering a competing product on Dec. 17. The trading is?a milestone in the acceptance of the digital currency by the world of mainstream investing, spurred in part by bitcoin's meteoric rise this year. Skeptics still abound, however, including executives at some of the world's largest banks. For the doubters, at least there's this silver lining: Futures trading may add an opportunity to burst what they see as a bubble.In the first week, more than 10,000 of Cboe's contracts -- representing about $180 million of bitcoin -- were traded, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was initially a big difference between the price of Cboe's product and the price of bitcoin, a sign the market wasn't very efficient. The gap peaked at 13 percent. But by the end of the week it had shrunk to less than 3 percent.?Bitcoin futures trading on CME -- a much bigger player than Cboe -- got off to a faster start and with more efficient pricing. About twice the value of the most active contract was traded in the first hour than on Cboe's debut. And the futures traded only about 2 percent higher than bitcoin itself after the first two hours.On a network of unregulated exchanges, which have their own prices for the digital currency -- and a long history of problems that range from service crashes to hacks and thefts. Buying and holding bitcoin is essentially a bet that its value will rise further. Not everybody who wants to get involved in this market thinks so.Futures contracts -- which derive their value from some underlying thing like corn, wheat, or in this case, a digital currency -- oblige a buyer to pay for something at an agreed-upon price at a certain date in the future. They can be used to make a bet on which way the market for a product is going to move. They can also be used to short a market, or bet that prices will fall.Three of the largest U.S. exchange companies, all overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are debuting bitcoin futures contracts. Along with Cboe and CME, Nasdaq Inc. is planning to introduce bitcoin futures next year. The other major U.S. exchange player, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., has not yet announced any plans to do so. ??We may be stupid for not being first on that,?? Jeff Sprecher, CEO of ICE, said at an investor conference this month.Exchanges want to offer what investors want to trade, and a lot more people want to trade in the bitcoin market than even a year ago. Coinbase, a large bitcoin exchange, was overwhelmed by heavy traffic as bitcoin soared toward $10,000 in late November. CME, which as recently as October hadn't made a decision on how to address cryptocurrencies, ultimately decided the allure was too much to resist. For traders, bitcoin offers an entirely new landscape to navigate. One hallmark of bitcoin trading is unpredictable price swings, a stark contrast to the eerie calm that's settled over other financial markets, including U.S. equities.Not everyone thinks derivatives based on bitcoin are ready for prime time. One worry is the volatility that so far has been a key feature of the digital currency market. Just three days before Cboe's product was slated to be introduced, bitcoin had one of its wildest sessions ever: On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, prices zoomed up to almost $20,000 from $16,000 in only about 90 minutes, before crashing back down.Some big traders think futures may be premature. The Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- said the contracts were rushed without enough consideration of the risks. In an open letter to the exchanges, the group questioned whether they would be able to adequately police market manipulation in bitcoin. The group said the exchanges should have sought more industry feedback on margin levels, trading limits and stress tests for the system before beginning trading. Cboe and CME are requiring traders to set aside an unusually large pile of cash to serve as collateral to back purchases.This simple question draws a surprising amount of debate in the investing world. While bitcoin advocates call it a currency, the CFTC views it as a commodity. Skeptics view it as a commodity without any intrinsic value, with demand driven by novelty and the scarcity imposed by bitcoin's software protocols, which will cap its production. Some analysts think it will trade more like a volatile stock, while others expect it to develop into a new asset class entirely. These arguments are being debated among trading desks at banks and hobbyists alike.Those who believe bitcoin is overheated have a chance to short the market with the introduction of bitcoin futures. Some hedge funds have been waiting for the chance to bet against the cryptocurrency. Interactive Brokers Group Inc. also decided to allow customers to bet against bitcoin futures under certain conditions. Previously, they only allowed clients to take long positions.??

The stock had traded at a 20 percent discount to its March 1 listing at the previous close.It marks the photo-sharing app's first upgrade since August, according to Bloomberg data, taking the proportion of analysts who recommend buying the shares above 20 percent.With Blue Apron now on equalweight footing, Sandler remains negative on just one stock -- Twitter Inc. The social media company trades about 23 percent below its November 2013 IPO price. Sandler's price target of $18 implies the shares may have a further 12 percent to fall."

Alberg and Lipton's research suggests a deep?neural network??C one with many layers ?C can?be effective for longer-term stock picking when it's fed mountains of fundamental corporate information like profit, revenue and debt levels.?They gave their system?16 common types of data?from financial statements and four other metrics on?stock price movements?over one-, three-, six- and nine-month periods. They did this for all the stocks?on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and American Stock Exchange for at least 12 consecutive months from?January 1970 to September 2017.Originally, the two asked the neural network to take in five years of data and then try to?forecast future stock prices one year out. But that performed no?better than a standard computer-based trading model.???The price bounces around a whole lot, independent of anything actually happening, at least in the short run,?? said Lipton, who is also at?Carnegie Mellon University. This erratic movement is called???noise?? in AI and data-science circles?and?the neural network got distracted by it, Alberg?added.?So the duo tried a different technique. Instead of asking the neural network to forecast the stock price a year out, they asked it to predict the future value of?company fundamentals, getting a forecast for things like earnings, before interest and tax (EBIT). They then divided that?by each company's current enterprise value, to end up with a kind of?AI-powered, forward-looking valuation?multiple.

Alberg said.The two said they will continue researching this area. One future project: Seeing if their neural network is better at forecasting company fundamentals than human equity analysts. They also want to see if performance will improve when they feed the system other data that contain clues about a company's future, such as executive comments on earnings conference calls."

Ormiston said at a briefing in London. ??It's been an absolute darling of short sellers and it has delivered well for them because it's been a horrendous environment for supermarket groups.?? Ahold Delhaize's 25 percent slide in the first eight months of 2017?has subsequently been pared to 7.4 percent, causing investors to ask whether the stock still provides value.?Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne thinks so, arguing that Amazon's?$13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods?Market Inc. is unlikely to measurably impact sales and profits at the Zaandam, Netherlands-based company. The grocer's ??very solid?? cash generation and 2 billion-euro ($2.4 billion) buyback next year mean it's likely to be a winner in 2018, said Monteyne, who has an outperform recommendation on the stock.Old Mutual's Ormiston sees discounters Aldi and Lidl as posing a bigger threat than Amazon.??In many other sectors, people are quite right to fear Amazon because of price deflation, because they are more efficient because of their buying power,?? he said in an interview after the briefing. ??I don't think their game in food,?if we look at what they bought, is about price.??That view is echoed by Charles Burbeck, a deputy portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management (UK) Ltd. in London. Burbeck sees food retailers with physical stores being less susceptible to online competition, and plans to increase his exposure to the supermarket sector in the UBS Global Equity Long Short Fund.??People are concerned that what Amazon has done to books and other parts of the retail sector they're going to do to the food retailing sector,?? said Burbeck,?who also owns shares in the U.S. e-commerce giant. ??Selling vegetables and peas and quiches is very different from selling books in terms of the supply distribution chain.??Meanwhile, supplier partnerships such as?Carrefour SA's purchasing agreement with Fnac Darty SA, will help ease pricing pressures and may also lead to a more efficient allocation of physical retail space longer term, Ormiston said.Even after a 24 percent drop this year, Carrefour isn't for everyone. Bernstein's Monteyne has a negative outlook on the grocer, which will present its turnaround strategy on Jan. 23. The potential implementation of a big cost-cutting program would be a bad idea because the French?retailer is still losing volume and large amounts of market share, he said. Monteyne downgraded Carrefour to underperform from market-perform earlier this month.??A good food retail recovery starts with boosting sales growth,?? Monteyne said. ??Once volumes are stable and growing, then cost-cutting can be effective. Cutting costs while volumes are still declining risks going into a negative spiral.??"
Top Oil Buyers Seek Chemistry in Love Affair With U.S. Crude,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/u-s-oil-cocktails-spoil-chemistry-in-budding-asian-love-affair,"December 14, 2017, 4:00 PM EST",technology,"""Grades like Eagle Ford, DSW are blends of oil and condensate"", ""Asia refiners say yield of fuels from composite oil fluctuates""","The world's biggest oil buyers are getting pickier about their American crude purchases.Asian refiners are discovering that the quality of cargoes varies, leading to fluctuations in the type of fuels they can produce. The?shale boom and the end of a U.S. oil-export ban have proven a boon to buyers?from China to India as traditional suppliers such as Saudi Arabia cut output to clear a glut. And while?shipments from the Gulf Coast have soared, refiners are shifting their focus to crudes with consistent characteristics.That's because?varieties such as Eagle Ford are a blend of shale oils pumped from wells in south Texas spanning an area about 65 times the size of New York City. Crude from the Middle East, Africa as well as the U.S. Gulf of Mexico come from a small cluster of fields with more stable chemical specifications. Buyers are now turning to conventional American grades such as?Mars and?Poseidon, or favoring shale supply piped from specific assets.??The flow of U.S. oil to Asia is here to stay, but Asian importers are learning that not all grades are equally desirable,?? says Tushar Tarun Bansal, a consultant from McKinsey Energy Insights. ??Buyers are wary of grades such as Eagle Ford and can't take much more of it.??Three Asian refiners that purchased and refined Eagle Ford shale oil don't plan to buy significant volumes of the grade due to concerns over the consistency of its quality, according to a Bloomberg survey of officials at the companies. Two of the three respondents said their cargoes -- each between 500,000 and 1 million barrels in size -- yielded more light distillates such as liquid petroleum gas and naphtha than they expected.Companies typically select a mix of different crudes to process, choosing grades based on chemical characteristics that will yield higher volumes of the fuels that are most in demand. When the oil specifications are inconsistent, plants may pump out less of the products that the refiners want and more of what they don't require at the time.According to the refiners and two sellers of U.S. crude to Asia, the variance in characteristics is acute for grades such as Eagle Ford and Domestic Sweet Crude -- an aggregate of oil from numerous streams that's blended in tanks such as those in the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.??Unlike Middle Eastern or West African crudes, which originate from one single large and stable reservoir, shale crudes are often extracted from multiple layers and can originate from different parts of a basin which have varying geological characteristics,?? said Virendra Chauhan, an analyst at industry consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.Eagle Ford consists of a blend of oil and ultralight crude called condensate that's pumped from thousands of wells in a formation that sprawls from Texas to Mexico. Its American Petroleum Institute gravity -- a measure of density -- ranges from 45 degrees to over 60 degrees.?Domestic Sweet Crude, or DSW, is a composite of crude from conventional and unconventional acreage in the U.S. and Canada with an API gravity reading of 37 to 42 degrees.In West Africa, Nigerian Qua Iboe crude is pumped from fields 20-40 miles off the country's coast and brought to shore directly via an under-sea pipeline linked to a designated export terminal. And in the Middle East, Abu Dhabi's Upper Zakum crude is extracted from three fields to Zirku Island for shipment abroad.Refiners are now trying out American oil from conventional Gulf of Mexico assets, as well as shale crude pumped and transported from a specific acreage. Some buyers like Taiwan's state-owned CPC Corp. are turning to imports of WTI Midland, a blend of shale oil from the Permian Basin that can be directly transported via the?BridgeTex pipeline to Houston for export.In its most recent tender, CPC bought 4 million barrels of the grade in its single largest purchase of the variety since buying its first cargo in May. South Korea's imports of WTI Midland in October more than doubled from a month earlier, and India's Bharat Petroleum Corp. also recently took the grade.Asian refiners are also seeking to load smaller quantities of U.S. shale oil with more-familiar grades from Mexico in big ships to mitigate quality risks and cut freight costs. The total volume of U.S. and Mexican crude that were loaded onto a single ship for export surged more than fivefold to 11.8 million barrels through the end of November,?from 2.1 million barrels in 2016, data from vessel-tracking and intelligence company Kpler show.About 350,000 barrels per day of oil flowed from the U.S. to Asia from January to September this year, according to Chen Bo, the president of Unipec.

Microsoft Takes Path Less Traveled to Build a Quantum Computer,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/microsoft-takes-path-less-traveled-to-build-a-quantum-computer,"December 11, 2017, 8:45 AM EST",technology,,"In the race to commercialize a new type of powerful computer, Microsoft Corp. has just pulled up to the starting line with a slick-looking set of wheels. There's just one problem: it doesn&apos;t have an engine ?C at least not yet.The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is competing with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, International Business Machines Corp. and a clutch of small, specialized companies to develop quantum computers ?C machines that, in theory, will be many times more powerful than existing computers by bending the laws of physics.Microsoft says it has a different approach that will make its technology less error-prone and more suitable for commercial use. If it works. On Monday, the company unveiled a new programming language called Q# ?C pronounced Q Sharp ?C and tools that help coders craft software for quantum computers. Microsoft is also releasing simulators that will let programmers test that software on a traditional desktop computer or through its Azure cloud-computing service.The machines are one of the advanced technologies, along with artificial intelligence and augmented reality, that Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella considers crucial to the future of his company. Microsoft, like IBM and Google, will most likely rent computing time on these quantum machines through the internet as a service.D-Wave Systems Inc. in 2011 became the first company to sell a quantum computer, although its technology has been controversial and can only perform a certain subset of mathematical problems. Google and IBM have produced machines that are thought to be close to achieving ??quantum supremacy?? ?C the ability to tackle a problem too complex to solve on any standard supercomputer. IBM and startup Rigetti Computing also have software for their machines.Microsoft, in contrast, is still trying to build a working machine. It is pursuing a novel design based on controlling an elusive particle called a Majorana fermion that no one was sure even existed a few years ago. Engineers are close to being able to control the Majorana fermion?in a way that will enable them to perform calculations, Todd Holmdahl, head of Microsoft's quantum computing efforts, said in an interview. Holmdahl, who led development of the Xbox and the company&apos;s HoloLens goggles, said Microsoft will have a quantum computer on the market within five years.??We are talking to multiple customers today and we are proposing quantum-inspired services for certain problems,?? he added.These systems push the boundaries of how atoms and other tiny particles work. While traditional computers process bits of information as 1s or zeros, quantum machines rely on ""qubits"" that can be a 1 and a zero at the same time. So two qubits can represent four numbers simultaneously, and three qubits can represent eight numbers, and so on. This means quantum computers can perform calculations much faster than standard machines and tackle problems that are way more complex.Applications could include things like creating new drugs and new materials or solving complex chemistry problems. The ??killer app?? of quantum computing is discovering a more efficient way to synthesize ammonia for fertilizer ?C a process that currently consumes three percent of the world's natural gas, according to Krysta Svore, who oversees the software aspects of Microsoft's quantum work.The technology is still emerging from a long research phase, and its capabilities are hotly debated. Researchers have only been able to keep qubits in a quantum state for fractions of a second. When qubits fall out of a quantum state they produce errors in their calculations, which can negate any benefit of using a quantum computer.Microsoft says it uses a different design ?C called a topological quantum computer ?C that in theory will create more stable qubits. This could?produce a machine with an error rate from 1,000 to?10,000 times better than computers other companies are building, Holmdahl said.Reducing or correcting the errors in quantum calculations is essential for the technology to fulfill its commercial potential, said Jonathan Breeze, a research fellow working on advanced materials at Imperial College London.The lower error rate of Microsoft&apos;s design may mean it can be more useful for tackling real applications -- even with a smaller number of qubits ?C perhaps less than 100. Svore said her team has already proven mathematically that algorithms that use a quantum approach can speed up machine learning applications substantially ?C enabling them to run as much as 4,000 times faster. (Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence behind recent advances in computers' ability to identify objects in images, translate languages and drive cars).""We want to solve today&apos;s unsolvable problems and we have an opportunity with a unique, differentiated technology to do that,"" Holmdahl said."
Chip Stocks Nvidia and Micron Are Tumbling Again,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/another-rout-for-chip-stocks-as-nvidia-and-micron-again-tumble,"December 4, 2017, 11:25 AM EST",markets,"""SP; 500 Semiconductor Index down for fifth time in six days"", ""Another rotation into banks keeps Dow and SP; 500 rallying""","A frantic rotation in the equity market once again sent chipmakers reeling, handing bulls their fifth drop in six days as investors reallocated into stocks seen as more likely to benefit from a tax cut.Losses were steepest in Nvidia Corp., the processor maker that was up 100 percent for the year as recently as Nov. 24, and?Advanced Micro Devices Inc., one of last year's best-performing technology companies. Semiconductor stocks have suffered amid a broader selloff in the technology industry, which at times in 2017 has been up twice as much as any other group.??It's a continuation. The immediate beneficiaries of the tax plan are financial stocks and industrials more so than technology and that's part of the logic behind that rotation,?? said Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ??We're still a little ways away from actual passage, but it's starting to look like something will get done.??Nvidia slid 5.6 percent at the close Monday, bringing its loss over the last six sessions to 14 percent. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. fell 6.5 percent to a 10-month low, Micron Technology Inc. slid 5 percent, On Semiconductor Corp. declined 4.4 percent and Applied Materials Inc. dropped 4.1 percent.Warnings have poured in from Wall Street brokerages over the last few days urging investors to lighten up on companies that have led the rally in 2017, specifically growth and momentum names that show up in hedge fund portfolios. JPMorgan Chase & Co. equity derivatives strategist Shawn Quigg wrote in a note that companies from Micron to Applied Materials may suffer as tax reform puts the focus on other industries.Along with the celebrated FANG group of Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., chip stocks have helped propel quantitative strategies that pile into the biggest winners. The MSCI USA Momentum index is up 35 percent in 2017, an advance that would mark its biggest annual rally since the dot-com era.Another potential issue for technology stock sentiment right now is that they don't pay that much to the federal government. Among sectors, the 18.5 percent effective tax rate enjoyed by the group is the third-lowest among U.S. large caps, according to S&P Global data. And that means less potential bounty should Republican legislation moves through Congress.??The tax reforms clearly has kicked off a massive unwind of what was the popular trade,?? said Aaron Clark, a fund manager at Boston-based GW&K Investment Management, which manages $36 billion in assets. ??The rubber band has stretched pretty far in one direction, it was bound to unwind itself a little bit. From a purely tax standpoint tech stocks are to benefit the least from a tax reform. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of this rotation is driven by quant models, which tend to be momentum following, so it's a little bit self-reinforcing.??Chipmakers, whose 43 percent surge before last Monday made them the best-performing group in the S&P 500, were summarily ousted from that throne last week as steady selling sent them down more than 5 percent on the week. A gauge of companies in S&P indexes that sell equipment for semiconductor production fell the most since 2009.Last week's volatility and losses ??were signs of what can happen when trends change and heavy positioning comes undone,?? Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist, said in a note on Monday. ??We do not think there is something more sinister afoot quite yet, but think the positive tax reform news forced a larger move toward cyclicals and relative tax beneficiaries that was funded by what seems like the universally preferred sector in the market -- tech.??"
How Counting the Dead Will Help the Living,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/data-driven-autopsies-aim-to-revamp-developing-world-health-care,"December 14, 2017, 1:00 PM EST",technology,"""Early Myanmar findings highlight stroke, heart-disease burden"", ""35 million deaths go unrecorded annually, undermining policies""","In Myanmar, most deaths occur at home and only a quarter are certified by doctors. That's worrisome, since not knowing why people die can undermine efforts to save lives.Now, innovative methods for counting the dead are being rolled out in the Southeast Asian nation, revealing previously under-appreciated patterns of disease that may change health policies and strategies. Known as verbal autopsies, the data-gathering relies on midwives quizzing family members. The answers to a questionnaire are then entered into a computer tablet that uses a software algorithm to come up with a probable cause of death.Results from the first 5,000 deaths collected from more than a dozen townships or districts are already challenging perceptions that pneumonia and diarrhea are among the biggest causes of death, according to Alan Lopez, the Rowden-White Chair of Global Health and Burden of Disease Measurement at the University of Melbourne, who is leading the research. Stroke and heart disease are instead coming up among the top killers.Alan Lopez??It's a kind of light bulb moment,?? said Lopez, who has been collating and analyzing mortality data for decades and is a co-author of the Global Burden of Disease Study, a research program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ??In Myanmar, they're really captivated by this and are committed to rolling it out.??Similar verbal autopsy and data-collection programs are being undertaken in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and 16 other low- and middle-income countries under a four-year, $100 million initiative funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Bloomberg Philanthropies was set up by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.About 35 million deaths go unrecorded globally, leaving dozens of nations unable to reliably track what kills their citizens. The Bloomberg Data for Health Initiative aims to help more than 1 billion people by providing the tools, systems and training to enable countries to record more accurate birth and death data.In the case of Myanmar, the 20-minute verbal autopsy process needs to be expanded to collect nationally representative samples that will generate reliable cause-of-death data. From that, evidence-based health policy decisions and prevention strategies for diseases such as type-2 diabetes can be formulated, Lopez said.The metabolic condition is already turning up in 5-to-8 percent of deaths in poor populations, Lopez said, ??and that's a surprise to governments.??Drugmakers, artificial intelligence companies, health insurers and pharmacy chains are also investing in data collection and analysis -- a market that research firm Research N Reports predicts will be worth more than $34.27 billion by 2022.CVS Health Corp. agreed this month to buy Aetna Inc. for about $67.5 billion. That will create a health-care giant that will be better equipped to track health information and drive down drug prices, said Thomas Laur, president of SAP SE's Connected Health group in Boston.??Some of the large transactions we have seen over the last couple of days, weeks and month are really focused on creating large health-care delivery platforms by bringing all this data together and trying to drive inefficiencies out of those systems,?? Laur said in an interview with Bloomberg TV last week.Routinely collected data can boost the efficiency of a health system by identifying strategies for producing ??good outcomes at an acceptable cost,?? said Luke Slawomirski, a health economist and policy analyst with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. ??However, no one data set can tell us everything.??A public health midwife conducts a verbal autopsy interview in Sri Lanka.Consequently, there's a need to link different sources of data, including from hospitals, clinics and pharmacies, to yield new insights and knowledge, Slawomirski said. ??Of course, linkage raises patient privacy risks, so we need sound data governance frameworks that manage the risks while maximizing the benefits of secondary use of these data.??One of the largest health threats that data from around the world are showing is obesity and its consequences, like diabetes -- a disease that has prompted lawmakers in countries from the U.K. to South Africa to pursue sugar taxes.??We will see the drive for timely and very local information continue,?? said Christopher Murray, professor of global health at the University of Washington and director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. ??I think we will also see this approach to highly standardized measurement spreading into allied areas of health -- things that are big determinants of health, like education.??Murray co-founded the Global Burden of Disease Study with Lopez in the 1990s, when the research involved fewer than a dozen people. There are now almost 3,000 collaborators on the study, which aims to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time.Murray's team is undertaking more disease modeling work to anticipate alternative health scenarios, and has received funding from the U.K. government, Wellcome Trust, and the Gates Foundation to analyze trends related to antimicrobial resistance, he said.??Data is at the core of every decision we make,?? said Trevor Mundel, president of global health at the Seattle-based Gates Foundation, the planet's largest private supporter of global health. ??Good data and smart analytics help us extract maximum value from our investments.????

In one of the more ambitious programs in the region, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has earmarked an unprecedented $180 billion for infrastructure to keep driving one of the world's best-performing economies over coming years. Malaysia and Thailand are also ramping up allocations to public works ahead of general elections in 2018.??Infrastructure has been under invested whether it's clear water, clean air, energy, roads, ports, railways, education, health care -- so there are tons of opportunities,?? said Ashish Goyal, head of emerging markets equities at NN Investment Partners (S) Ltd., which manages $288 billion in assets. The firm owns stakes in Indonesian construction stocks, he said, adding that investors should watch for the pace of execution in the various countries.UBS Group AG expects ??changes in government policy and delivery on infrastructure?? to be among the region's biggest themes for 2018 as growth in global trade fades, analysts including Ian Gisbourne wrote in a report dated Nov. 28.Construction stocks on the MSCI Asean Index have risen an average of about 7.4 percent this year in dollar terms, about one-third the gain of the overall gauge, which is set for its best performance in seven years. Technology shares have provided the biggest boost to the Southeast Asian index this year as global demand for electronics returned.Some builders are already rallying in anticipation of the rewards they will reap from the spike in infrastructure outlays. Indonesian cement supplier PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa soared as much as 54 percent earlier this year as investors expect it to benefit from a surge in demand as the nation builds toll roads, ports and power plants. Manila-based EEI Corp. has surged 73 percent, leading a rally in Philippine construction stocks, as it begins work on the nation's $1.6 billion, 44 kilometer (27 mile) mass-railway project.Infrastructure development and more Chinese investments into the Philippines could support stocks with net asset value of the nation's developers expanding by as much as 12 percent over the next three years, writes Goldman Sachs?Group Inc. analysts including Paul Lian in a report dated Dec. 7.Companies that provide services for construction projects, such as improving management efficiency or sustainability, may also capitalize on the spending boom on public works, Felix Lam, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas SA's asset management arm, said by phone.Even so, the Southeast Asian market as a whole might continue to underperform, compared to ??its larger, more liquid and faster growing North Asia and India counterparts,?? Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Timothy Moe wrote in a November report. And Credit Suisse Group AG has maintained its underweight rating on the region for 2018.Still, Morgan Stanley sees investor attention back on the Asean region as markets are expected to give returns of as much as 10 percent next year, more than three times what's seen for emerging markets.Here is a breakdown of what countries are planning and what investors are saying about Southeast Asia's infrastructure spending spree:"

It also comes as oil companies seek to burnish their image and boost the clean energy profile of gas to make it more attractive for foreign buyers seeking lower-carbon sources of electricity.""Producers have to think about the world outside the United States, and they have to think about the world after Donald Trump --?and both of those things matter when it comes to making an investment with a 15-, 20- or 50-year life"" said Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners LLC. ""For producers to credibly sell natural gas as a clean fuel into a greening world, they have to credibly show emissions-reduction technologies.""As World Edges Away From Coal, Trump Seeks Revival: QuickTakeMethane, the main ingredient in natural gas, has been shown to warm the atmosphere 84 times more than carbon dioxide when measured over two decades.

And the Trump administration's efforts to loosen emission-cutting requirements could worsen the situation.?Under President Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency has halted writing another methane regulation for new and modified wells, and the Interior Department is planning changes to a separate Obama-era rule that applied on public land.Erik Milito, an API group director, said the initiative is ""robust"" but flexible, designed to encourage companies to collaborate and share data from the field. The participating energy companies -- representing at least 26 percent of U.S. gas production -- commit to take ""tangible steps"" to address methane emissions and in exchange are free to use the initiative's green-and-blue emblem on websites and in other material.Read more: Natural Gas Moves to the Naughty List""Companies are signing agreements and they're reporting the actual progress they are making,"" Milito said. ""This is not an initiative where we are talking about what can be done; this is an initiative where companies have agreed and signed agreements to actually take the action and follow it up with reports.""Companies in the API initiative have agreed to seek out and repair methane leaks at tens of thousands of sites located in every major U.S. gas and oil basin, with detection required at least once every two years. That is less frequent than the twice-annual timetable the Interior Department imposed under a regulation last year, and the standard in some states.The companies also are committing to phase out high-bleed pneumatic controllers that release gas as part of their normal operation. Analysts say it's one of the most cost-effective emission control technologies industry can employ, with replacement devices potentially paying for themselves after just six months -- one reason some 25,000 have already been swapped out across the U.S.Participants will provide information on their efforts annually to API, with the trade group releasing an annual report using aggregated information.?That may fall short of the transparency some environmentalists and shareholders have been demanding.?Oil companies have been under increasing pressure from shareholders and local communities where they operate to address the issue.Voluntary methane-reduction programs should embody leading practices for controlling emissions and be backed by robust transparency, said Matt Watson, associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund's climate and energy program.""If you're going to put forward a voluntary program as part of the solution here -- and it can never be the full solution -- those emission reductions need to be verifiable,"" Watson said.The new effort also departs from some recent methane-cutting commitments that have set a more robust ""near-zero"" emissions target. When eight major oil companies, including BP Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Statoil Asa, pledged on Nov. 22 to cut methane emissions, they also said they would support ""sound"" regulations governing the issue."

He cited a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision affirming the FCC's authority.While Pai's plan expressly barred individual states from enacting their own regulations, there may be a court fight ahead to clarify the fine line between where federal authority ends and a state's power to protect its citizens begins, said Matthew Schettenhelm, an attorney and government litigation analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. He said that despite Pai's effort to avoid a patchwork of local requirements, states aren't completely sidelined.Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward J. Markey said he would mount a two-pronged attack to preserve the rules. Besides supporting legal action, he and other lawmakers said they would introduce a resolution under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to overturn some actions of regulatory agencies.""We will fight the FCC's decisions in the courts, and we will fight it in the halls of Congress,??

The prospect of large companies, including Amgen Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc., bringing cash back to the U.S. may spur some highly anticipated deals in a space that has been tracking this year to the lowest volume of transactions since 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The market will be favorable for biotech companies, at least in the short-term, with tax repatriation a tailwind that could stimulate a more positive view for both large and small companies, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote in a note. Gilead and Amgen both hold more than $20 billion outside of the U.S., so the ability to employ that capital in a domestic setting via mergers and acquisitions, dividends and repurchases is a ??win-win for large and small biotech.??A spike in deal activity within the health-care space has been highly anticipated since Gilead's purchase of Kite Pharma Inc. for $12 billion in August was seen as a promising sign. Some health-care investors, including Orbimed founding partner Sven Borho, say it's ??prime time?? for biotech and pharma deals with further tax clarity paving the way for large, transformative moves.While biotech's heavyweights ??all have warts,?? shown by the group's disappointing third quarter, the positives of the potential tax reform are likely to outweigh the negatives to create an environment that is quite favorable for specialist investors after generalists exited their positions, Cowen's biotech team wrote.The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ended November up less than 1 percent after the group was whipsawed by a large-cap earnings selloff that wiped more than $61 billion from the group's market capitalization in October. The earnings letdown triggered generalist investors to move their chips to the sidelines as they exited the group that struggled to find its footing last month.While most fundamental catalysts aren't expected until early 2018, namely JPMorgan's annual San Francisco health-care conference and potential approvals from U.S. regulators, the prospect of some form of tax relief for companies will likely give the group the slight bump it needs heading into year-end.The passage of a tax bill will likely occur between the middle of December and early 2018 and will be an important macro tailwind for the biopharma space over the next one to two years, Credit Suisse analysts led by Alethia Young wrote in a note.??With so much cash overseas, we do believe that tax reform policies will indeed drive future merger and acquisition decision making,?? the analysts said, noting that Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co. may also benefit on the pharmaceuticals side.??

What you get is a startup hub.A year ago, venture capitalists Stephen Forte of Fresco Capital Fund and Eric Harr of Imagine Ventures -- both based in California -- asked the Vatican to back a technology competition among startups addressing climate change, energy and managing resources.Surprisingly for a Church that can trace its history back some 2,000 years, and that only four years ago decided to ditch Latin as the?official language for the major meetings of its bishops, the Vatican was keen.The result -- where nine startups out of about 300 entrants have each received $100,000 in equity investments -- marks another shift in the Vatican reaching out to the tech sector. Investors include Ibrahim AlHusseini, founder and managing partner of the FullCycle Energy Fund, which funds companies focusing on turning waste into clean energy, Emirati social entrepreneur Badr Jafar, and early Google engineer Chade-Meng Tan.Cardinal Turkson at Laudato Si Challenge Demo Day, Dec. 4.Although the Vatican will not offer any funding, instead putting up a venue and offering mentoring and the influence of Cardinal Peter Turkson, Pope Francis's top adviser on environmental issues. The program is called Laudato Si, echoing the Pope's 2015 encyclical -- one of the major forms of papal writings -- which urged nations to pull ??Mother Earth?? out of a ??spiral of self-destruction.??""Hi-tech, artificial intelligence and all those elements can contribute to the well-being of the Earth,"" said Cardinal Turkson,?who personally manages his Twitter and Facebook pages. ""High technology is a product of the human mind. And in this encyclical the challenge of science plays a very crucial part.""In December, nine startups made it through to the final stage of a challenge aimed to apply Francis's vision on climate change to hi-tech ideas. The demo was hosted in one of the many Vatican owned territories scattered across Rome, while a gala dinner the following day was set in one of the city's luxury hotels.The pull of the Vatican has helped attract tech founders and celebrities. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone shared advice in a talk to the entrepreneurs on the program.?Turkson met the investors and startup founders, and hosted a demo-event on Vatican territory on 4 December, featuring U.S. actor Danny De Vito who gave the cardinal a bear-hug.??The Vatican is coming of age. Why keep the Catholic church and its leaders in the dark age??? joked Giovanni Tomaselli, founder of imaging platform ION360, and a sponsor of Laudato Si. ??The Vatican gives balance to Silicon Valley, which is all about killing it.??Francis isn't particularly tech-savvy as far as his daily life goes. He uses an old Ford Focus to get around the Vatican and Rome, and in November he told the faithful not to pick up their mobile phones to take photographs during Mass.?Francis hasn't been seen using a mobile phone in public since he became pope, but he does have millions of Twitter followers. On the fifth anniversary of setting up his Twitter account on 12 December, he tweeted ""May social media always be spaces that are rich in humanity.""While the leaders and the Laudato Si team, which included support staff, photographers, a communications firm, predominately come from Silicon Valley, the entrepreneurs are spread across a range of backgrounds. For 30-year-old Josh Israel, a journey from New Jersey to the Vatican could prove a make-or-break opportunity for his startup.??The Vatican has opened doors for us with investors. It put a stamp on us,"" said Israel, the co-founder of?P??pr, a software application designed to reduce the use of paper in offices. ""The return on investment for coming to the Vatican has been high,"" he said. His firm received 300,000 dollars in investments thanks to the project.Among the others inventions which made it to Rome were technology to turn waste from breweries into flour, a filter to allow people to drink directly from polluted water and a solar light bulb replacing highly-polluting kerosene lamps.Valeria Sanchez, 25, from the Mexican city of Guadalajara, is one of four women who founded Protrash, an app which helps communities to collect plastic and aluminum waste. ??We are here because of Pope Francis, he made a revolution on climate change,?? she said.From now on, the nine companies will be on their own to seek further funding for their ideas. But the network established during those months and the impact of the ""Vatican stamp"" are likely to help the companies to secure more financial backing. Meanwhile investors including Tomaselli are already getting ready for the second round of the challenge.Recalling a guided tour of Vatican City he went on,?P??pr's Israel saw new business potential. ??I'd love to help the Vatican reduce the amount of paper it uses for printing,?? he said. ??But my impression is that the Church's time-line is from here to Eternity.????
